      CHAPTER I.&mdash;ASSERTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he end of October
      had been more than usually fine, and now the beginning of November was
      following the good example set by its predecessor. In the Home Park, the
      only part of the extensive grounds surrounding Hampton Court Palace that
      was well wooded, the leaves had not entirely left the branches, and the
      turf beneath was green and firm, as yet unsodden by autumnal rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along one of the forest aisles there walked a distinguished party,
      proceeding slowly, for the pace was set by a disease-stricken man whose
      progress was of painful deliberation. He was tall and thin; his body was
      prematurely bent, though accustomed to be straight enough, if one might
      judge by the masterful brow, now pallid with illness, or by the glance of
      the piercing eye untamed even by deadly malady. That he was not long for
      this earth, if Nature had her way, a scrutinizer of that handsome,
      powerful face might have guessed; yet he was singled out for destruction
      even before his short allotted time, for at that moment his enemies,
      hedged in secrecy behind locked doors, were anxiously planning his ruin.
      They were wise in their privacy, for, had a whisper of their intentions
      gone abroad, the Earl of Strafford would have struck first and struck
      hard, as, indeed, he intended to do in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, was accompanied by an imposing train.
      On either side of him, accommodating their slow steps to his, were some of
      the highest in the land, who waited on his words and accorded him a
      deference more obsequious than that with which they might have
      distinguished the King himself; for all knew that this shattered frame was
      more to be dreaded than the most stalwart personage who that day trod
      English soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind this noble circle followed a numerous band of attendants, alert for
      beck or call, each having place according to his degree. A huntsman was
      surrounded by dogs kept in thrall by fear of the whip. Falconers with
      hooded hawks attested a favorite sport of the Earl, who loved to have the
      birds near him even though he made no trial of their flight. And here he
      walked the grounds of the King as if he owned them; as though he were
      permanent master instead of transient guest. Here he rested for the
      moment, hoping to recover some remnant of health by the placid Thames,
      after his troublous journey from Ireland, which turbulent country lay numb
      under his strong hand, soon to be vocal enough when the hounds were upon
      him. No echo of London&rsquo;s clamour came to this green paradise. He knew the
      mob was crying out against him, as in truth the whole country cried; but
      he heeded not the howl, despising his opponents. Better for him had he
      been more wary or more conciliatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those now in his company was young De Courcy, one of the numerous
      band of Frenchmen smilingly received at Court because the consort of
      Charles had a predilection for her countrymen,&mdash;a preference unshared
      by any save her husband. The French contingent thought little of the
      scowls of the English so long as those in authority smiled on them and the
      smile brought profit. They were regarded as titled mercenaries; spies
      probably, anxious to feather their own nests at the expense of the
      Treasury; possibly the propagating agents of a Church of which England had
      a deep distrust; certainly possessing an overweening influence at Court,
      dividing still further the unfortunate King from his suspicious people. It
      might have been imagined that so thoroughly English, so strenuous a man as
      Strafford, the last to be deluded by suave manners or flattery, although
      he had an insatiable appetite for cringing deference, yet uninfluenced by
      it (as witness his crushing of Lord Montmorris in Ireland), would have
      shown scant friendship for frivolous French nobles; but it was a fact that
      he bore from young De Courcy a familiarity of address that he would have
      suffered from none other in the kingdom. Courtiers find a ready reason for
      every action, and they attributed Strafford&rsquo;s forbearance to the influence
      De Courcy possessed with the Queen, for his lordship was well aware that
      his sovereign lady showed small liking for the King&rsquo;s most powerful
      minister. Strafford was too keen a politician not to make every endeavour
      to placate an enemy who at all hours had access to the private ear of his
      master, on whose breath depended his own elevation. Therefore it may well
      be that he thought it worth while to conciliate one of the haughty lady&rsquo;s
      favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation under the trees was lightly frivolous, despite the
      seriousness of the time. Strafford was not one to wear his heart on his
      sleeve, and if he was troubled that the King insisted on his presence in
      London, refusing to him permission to return to Ireland, where he was
      safe,&mdash;the wielder of the upper hand,&mdash;his manner or expression
      gave no hint of his anxiety. A cynical smile curved his bloodless lips as
      he listened to the chatter of De Courcy, not noticing the silence of the
      others, who disdained a conversational contest with the voluble Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give your lordship my assurance,&rdquo; insisted the young man, &ldquo;that his
      Majesty was much perturbed by the incident. All Scots are superstitious,
      and the King has Scottish blood in his veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to superstition, I have never learned,&rdquo; said Strafford, speaking
      slowly, &ldquo;that the French are entirely free from some touch of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; continued De Courcy airily, &ldquo;but her Majesty, who is
      French, advised the King to think nothing more of the encounter, so she
      regards but lightly any predictions of doom from an old gipsy hag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were no predictions of doom, and no gipsy hag. The case was of the
      simplest, now exaggerated by Court gossip,&rdquo; amended the Earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I have it almost direct from the King himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your &lsquo;almost&rsquo; will account for anything. It was merely a piece of
      youthful impertinence which should have been punished by one of the park
      rangers, had any been present. The King had honoured me with his company
      in the park. We were alone together, discussing problems of State, when
      there suddenly sprang out before us a smiling, froward girl, who cried,
      &lsquo;Merry gentlemen, I will predict your fortunes if in return you tell me
      where I may find the Earl of Strafford.&rsquo; His Majesty looked at me, and the
      hussy, quick to take a hint, evidently saw that I was the person sought.
      In any case the King&rsquo;s remark must have confirmed her suspicion. &lsquo;Your
      predictions are like to prove of small value,&rsquo; said his Majesty, &lsquo;if you
      ask such a question. Here you have two men before you. Choose the
      greater.&rsquo; Whereupon the wench seized my hand before I was aware, and the
      King laughed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an uncourtierlike proceeding,&rdquo; said De Courcy. &ldquo;That young woman
      will not advance in a world which depends on the smile of the mighty for
      promotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The choice shows her a true prophet,&rdquo; muttered one of the nobles; but
      Strafford, paying no heed, went on with his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words which followed were more diplomatic than the action. &lsquo;You are
      the King&rsquo;s best friend,&rsquo; she said, examining the palm she had taken. Then
      his Majesty cried, &lsquo;What do you read in my hand?&rsquo; &lsquo;You are the King&rsquo;s
      worst enemy,&rsquo; said the pert hussy. This nonplussed Charles for the moment,
      who replied at last, &lsquo;I think you are more successful with my comrade.
      Read all you find in his palm, I beg of you.&rsquo; Then the gipsy, if such she
      was, went glibly on. &lsquo;Your fate and that of the King are interwoven. If
      you overcome your enemies, the King will overcome his. If you fall, the
      King falls. Your doom will be the King&rsquo;s doom; your safety the King&rsquo;s
      safety. At the age you shall die, at that age will the King die, and from
      the same cause.&rsquo; His Majesty laughed, somewhat uneasily I thought, but
      said jauntily, &lsquo;I have the advantage of you, Strafford, for you may die at
      any moment, but I am given seven years to live, being that space younger
      than you.&rsquo; I was annoyed at the familiarity of the creature, and bade her
      take herself off, which she did after making vain appeal for some private
      conversation with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she fair to look upon? In that case I do not wonder at your
      indignation. To learn that a handsome and young woman was searching for
      you in the lonely forest, to meet her at last, but in company of a King so
      rigid in his morals as Charles, was indeed a disappointment. You had been
      more favoured with any other monarch of Europe beside you. Had you no
      chance of getting one private word with her; of setting time and place for
      a more secluded conference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight frown ruffled the broad, smooth brow of the statesman, but it
      vanished on the instant, and he shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I but gave you a brief account of a very simple incident that you were
      inclined to make much of. You have now the truth, and so may dress the
      retailing of it in the guise that best pleases you. I make no doubt &rsquo;twill
      be fanciful enough when next I hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it any other monarch than Charles, I should say he was annoyed to
      find his minister so favoured; but in his mind the prediction will take
      more space than thought of the prophet, be she never so young or so fair.
      But all good wishes go toward you, my lord. It is my prayer that when next
      you meet the woodland sylph you are alone in the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if to show how little profit follows the prayer of a French exquisite,
      there stepped out from behind a thick tree in front of them the person of
      whom they spoke. She was tall and slender, with dancing eyes of midnight
      blackness, which well matched the dark, glossy ringlets flowing in
      profusion over her shapely shoulders. Her costume betokened the country
      rather than the Court, yet its lack of fashionable cut or texture was not
      noticed in a company of men, and the almost universal gaze of admiration
      that rested on her showed that in the eyes of the majority she was well
      and tastefully garbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord of Strafford,&rdquo; she said in a sweet clear voice, &ldquo;I crave a word
      with you in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy laughed provokingly; the others remained silent, but turned
      their regard from the interloper to the Earl, whose frown of annoyance did
      not disappear as it had done before. Strafford spoke no word, but his
      underlings were quick to interpret and act upon his black look. Two
      attendants silently took places beside the girl, ready to seize her did
      his lordship give a sign. The huntsmen let loose the dogs that had been
      snarling at the newcomer. They made a dash at her, while she sprang nimbly
      to the tree that had concealed her, having first whisked from the scabbard
      of an astonished attendant the light sword with which he was supposed to
      guard himself or his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call off your hounds, you villain!&rdquo; she cried in a voice that had the
      true ring of command in it; indeed, to many there the order had a touch of
      the Earl&rsquo;s own tones in anger. &ldquo;I ask not for my own escape from scath,
      but for theirs. I&rsquo;d rather transfix a man than hurt a dog. You scoundrel,
      you shall feel the sting of this point if you do not instantly obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thin shining blade darted here and there like an adder&rsquo;s tongue, and
      as painfully. Yelp after yelp showed its potency, and the dogs, quick to
      learn that they were overmatched, abated their fury and contented
      themselves with noisy outcry at a safe distance from the semicircle of
      danger, jumping sideways and backward, barking valorously, but keeping
      well clear of the rapier. At a glance from the Earl the huntsman whipped
      them back into their former places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lash them, you whelp, but it&rsquo;s over your own shoulders the cord
      should go, had I the ordering, thou meanest of the pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Earl of Strafford sternly, &ldquo;I would have you know that
      none give orders here but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that you are mistaken, my lord. You have just heard me give them, and
      furthermore have seen them obeyed. But aside from the ordering of either
      you or me, I understand this to be the King&rsquo;s park.&rdquo; Again De Courcy
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hit you there, my lord,&rdquo; he had the temerity to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strafford paid no attention to his gibe, but gazed darkly at the fearless
      intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, my lord. I wish a word in your private ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out what you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is to be heard by none but the Earl of Strafford; no, not even
      by the King himself; for, you should know, were it other fashion, I would
      have spoken when last I encountered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no secrets from the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor need this be one. &rsquo;T is yours to proclaim to the world at your
      pleasure. But first it is for your ear alone. Send that painted popinjay
      to the rear with the dogs. The others are gentlemen and will retire of
      their own accord when they learn a lady wishes to speak privily with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the turn of the English nobles to laugh, which they did merrily
      enough, but De Courcy seemed less pleased with the rude suggestion. He
      fumbled at his sword-hilt, and muttered angrily that if any present wished
      to make the girl&rsquo;s reference his own, a meeting could be speedily arranged
      to discuss the question. Strafford, however, had no mind for any by-play.
      His glance quelled the rising difference; then he said harshly to the
      young woman,&mdash;&ldquo;What do you here in the King&rsquo;s park, lacking
      permission, as I suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried the girl with a toss of the head, &ldquo;they say, where I come
      from, that everything seemingly possessed by the King belongs actually to
      the people, and being one of the people I come to my own domain asking
      permission of none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are young to speak treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is no treason of mine. I but repeat what others say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, how came you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily. Over the wall. I was refused access to you by any other means, so
      I took the method that suggested itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were feigning yesterday to be a gipsy. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I wish to tell your lordship when I get the opportunity. As
      for yesterday, I feigned nothing. I but retold what an old gipsy once said
      to me regarding the King and Lord Strafford. I wished to engage your
      attention, but, like the underlings of this palace, you turned me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your persistence shall be rewarded, but with this proviso. If the news
      you make so much of is not worth the telling, then shall you expiate your
      impudence in prison. If you fear to accept the risk, you had better begone
      while there is yet time, and let us see no more of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the hazard freely, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Strafford said no more, but turned to his followers, who at
      once withdrew to the background, except De Courcy, who, not having
      forgiven the insult placed upon him, and unconscious that his reluctance
      to quit the spot was giving point to the girl&rsquo;s invective, cried angrily,&mdash;&ldquo;Beware,
      Lord Strafford. There may be more in this than appears on the surface. She
      has shown herself expert with a stolen blade. That blade is still in her
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl smiled coldly; he was unused to disobedience even where it
      concerned his own safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but fair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I should take some risk to equal
      hers. I&rsquo;ll chance the stroke. Your prayer was that I should meet this
      damsel alone in the forest. Do not, I beg of you, prevent fulfilment of
      your devout petition by further tarrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before this was spoken the girl had flung the borrowed rapier far into
      the forest glade, then waved her disencumbered hand to the departing
      Frenchman, saying mockingly,&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell, popinjay. The treacherous
      ever make suggestion of treachery.&rdquo; To the Earl she added, &ldquo;My lord, I am
      entirely unarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say to me?&rdquo; replied Strafford severely, bending his dark
      gaze upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice lowered so that none might by any chance overhear,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir,
      I am Frances Wentworth, your lordship&rsquo;s eldest daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;RECOGNITION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Earl lowered
      upon the girl, and the black anger upon his brow might have warned a more
      intrepid person than even she appeared to be that there was peril in
      trifling. When at last he spoke, his voice was harsh and menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to gain by a statement so preposterous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to gain a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s answer trod quick upon the heels of the question, but her
      colour changed from red to pale, and from pale to red again, and her
      hurried breathing hinted of some knowledge of her hazard, which
      nevertheless she faced without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eldest daughter, say you? My eldest daughter is Ann, aged thirteen, a
      modest little maid. I take you to be older, and I should hesitate to apply
      to you the qualification I have just coupled with her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sixteen, therefore her senior. Thus one part of my contention is
      admitted. If she is modest, it doth become a maid, and is reasonably to be
      expected, for she hath a mother&rsquo;s care. I have had none. If you detect a
      boldness in my manner, &rsquo;t is but another proof I am my father&rsquo;s
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something resembling a grimace rather than a smile disturbed the white
      lips of Strafford at this retort. He bent his eyes on the ground, and his
      mind seemed to wander through the past. They stood thus in silence
      opposite each other, the girl watching him intently, and when she saw his
      mouth twitch with a spasm of pain, a great wave of pity overspread her
      face and brought the moisture to her eyes; but she made no motion toward
      him, held in increasing awe of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boldness is not a virtue,&rdquo; he muttered, more to himself than to her.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a jade in England who can claim no relationship with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark, calling for no response, received none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen years of age! Then that was in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl paused in his ruminations as if the simple mathematical problem
      baffled him, the old look of weariness and pain clouding his downturned
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The year 1624,&rdquo; said the girl promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, doubtless. 1624. It is long since; longer than the days that
      have passed seem to indicate. I was a young man then, now&mdash;&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;I
      am an aged wreck, and all in sixteen years. And so in you, the spirit of
      youth, the unknown past confronts me, demanding&mdash;&mdash;demanding
      what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Demanding nothing, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph. You are the first then. They all want something. You think I am an
      old dotard who is ready, because you say you want nothing, to accept your
      absurd proposal. But I am not yet fifty, nor as near it as these fell
      maladies would have me appear; and a man should be in his prime at fifty.
      Madam, it will require more convincing testimony to make me listen to you
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The testimony, irrefutable, stands here before you. Raise your eyes from
      the ground, my lord, and behold it. If, scrutinizing me, you deny that I
      am your daughter, I shall forthwith turn from you and trouble you no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford slowly lifted his gloomy face, prematurely seamed with care, and
      his heavy eyes scanned closely the living statue that confronted him. The
      sternness of his features gradually relaxed, and an expression near akin
      to tenderness overspread his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man might be proud to claim you, my girl, no matter how many other
      reasons for pride he possessed. But you have not come here merely because
      someone flattered the Earl of Strafford by saying you resembled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord. I am come to return to you this document which once you
      presented to my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed him a paper, which he read with intent care. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I have, in little, much to say to you, or else one of us must be much
      to blame. But in truth I have that confidence in you, and that assurance
      in myself, as to rest secure the fault will never be made on either side.
      Well, then; this short and this long which I aim at is no more than to
      give you this first written testimony that I am your husband; and that
      husband of yours that will ever discharge these duties of love and respect
      toward you which good women may expect, and are justly due from good men
      to discharge them; and this is not only much, but all which belongs to me;
      and wherein I shall tread out the remainder of life which is left to me&mdash;&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford looked up from his perusal, blank amazement upon his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you by this paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it among the documents left by my grandfather, who died a year
      ago. It was sent by you to my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny the script?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny it, but &rsquo;t was written by me eight years since, and
      presented to my third wife, whom I married privately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your third wife? Who was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was Mistress Elizabeth Rhodes, and is now Lady Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is your fourth wife. You will see by your own inditing that this
      letter was written in March, 1624.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The date was unmistakably set down by the same hand that had penned the
      bold signature, &ldquo;Thomas Wentworth,&rdquo; and the bewilderment of the Earl
      increased as he recognized that here was no forgery, but a genuine letter
      antedating its duplicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, &ldquo;that a man has so little
      originality as to do practically the same thing twice?&rdquo; Then aloud to the
      girl he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped the reading of this document would have rendered your
      question unnecessary. Has a man such gift of forgetting, that the very
      name of the woman he solemnly married has slipped his memory as easily as
      the writing of the letter she cherished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was Frances, daughter of Sir John Warburton,&rdquo; murmured the Earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His only daughter, as I am hers, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when Sir John wrote me coldly of her death, he made no mention of any
      issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather always hated you, my lord. It is very like that he told
      you not the cause of my mother&rsquo;s death was her children&rsquo;s birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord. My twin brother and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ashen hue overspread the Earl&rsquo;s face, and the hand that held the letter
      trembled until the fateful missive shook like one of the autumn leaves on
      the tree above it. Again his mind wandered through the past and conjured
      up before him the laughing face of his supposedly only son, whose position
      was thus unexpectedly challenged by a stranger, unknown and unloved. A
      daughter more or less was of small account, but an elder son promised
      unsuspected complications. The ill favour with which he had at first
      regarded the girl returned to his troubled countenance, and she saw with
      quick intuition that she had suddenly lost all the ground so gradually
      gained. Cold dislike tinctured the tone in which the next question was
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, as you say, you have a brother, why is he not here in your place; you
      in the background, where you properly belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I suppose that her good name is thought more of by a woman than by a
      man. She wishes to be assured that she came properly authenticated into
      this world, whereas a man troubles little of his origin, so be it he is
      here with some one to fight or to love. Or perhaps it is that the man is
      the deeper, and refuses to condone where a woman yearns to forgive. My
      brother shares our grandfather&rsquo;s dislike of you. He thinks you cared
      little for our mother, or you would not have been absent during her last
      days when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing of it. The times then, as now, were uncertain, requiring
      absorbed attention from those thrown willingly or unwillingly into public
      affairs. What can a boy of sixteen know of the duties thrust upon a man in
      my situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen or not, he considers himself even now a man of position, and he
      holds your course wrong. He says he has taken up the opinions you formerly
      held, and will do his best to carry them to success. He is for the
      Parliament and against the King. As for me, I know little of the questions
      that disturb the State. My only knowledge is that you are my father, and
      were you the wickedest person in the world I would come to you. A man may
      have many daughters, but a daughter can have but one father; therefore am
      I here, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like the quick succession of shade and sunshine over the sensitive surface
      of a lovely lake, the play of varying emotions added an ever-changing
      beauty to the girl&rsquo;s expressive face; now a pitiful yearning toward her
      father when she saw he suffered; then a coaxing attitude, as if she would
      win him whether he would or no; again a bearing of pride when it seemed
      she would be denied; and throughout all a rigid suppression of herself, a
      standing of her ground, a determination not to give way to any rising
      sentiment which might make the after repulse a humiliation; if a retreat
      must come it should be carried out with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Strafford saw nothing of this, for his eyes were mostly on the
      ground at his feet. That his mind was perturbed by the new situation so
      unexpectedly presented to him was evident; that he was deeply suspicious
      of a trap was no less clear. When he looked up at her he found his iron
      resolution melting in spite of himself, and, as he wished to bring an
      unclouded judgment to bear upon the problem, he scrutinized the brown
      sward at his feet. Nevertheless he was quick to respond to any show of
      sympathy with himself, even though he was unlikely to exhibit
      appreciation, and he was equally quick to resent the slightest lack of
      deference on the part of those who addressed him. If the girl had made a
      thorough study of his character she could not have better attuned her
      manner to his prejudices. Her attitude throughout was imbued with the
      deepest respect, and if the eye refused to be advocate for her, the ear
      could not close itself to the little thrill of affection that softened her
      tone as she spoke to him. He raised his head abruptly as one who has come
      to a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;November is the stepmother of the months, and the air grows cold. Come
      with me to the palace. In a world of lies I find myself believing you;
      thus I am not grown so old as I had feared. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl tripped lightly over the rustling leaves and was at his side in
      an instant, then slowed her pace in unison with his laboured mode of
      progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, will you lean upon my shoulder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am ailing, but not decrepit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked together in silence, and if any viewed them the onlookers were
      well concealed, for the park seemed deserted. Entering the palace and
      arriving at the foot of a stairway, solicitous menials proffered
      assistance, but Strafford waved them peremptorily aside, and, accepting
      now the support he had shortly before declined, leaned on his daughter&rsquo;s
      shoulder and wearily mounted the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room on the first floor into which he led her overlooked a court. A
      cheerful fire burned on the hearth and cast a radiance upon the sombre
      wainscoting of the walls. A heavy oaken table was covered with a litter of
      papers, and some books lay about. Into a deep arm-chair beside the fire
      Strafford sank with a sigh of fatigue, motioning his daughter to seat
      herself opposite him, which she did. He regarded her for some moments with
      no pleased expression on his face, then said with a trace of petulancy in
      the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your grandfather bring you up a lady, or are you an ignorant country
      wench?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew in quickly the small feet out-thrust to take advantage of the
      comforting fire, and the blaze showed her cheek a ruddier hue than
      heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the children of the great, neglected by the great, must
      perforce look to themselves. I was brought up, as you know, without a
      mother&rsquo;s care, in the ancient hall of a crusty grandfather, a brother my
      only companion. We played together and fought together, as temper willed,
      and he was not always the victor, although he is the stronger. I can
      sometimes out-fence him, and, failing that, can always outrun him. Any
      horse he can ride, I can ride, and we two have before now put to flight
      three times our number among the yokels of the neighborhood. As to
      education, I have a smattering, and can read and write. I have studied
      music to some advantage, and foreign tongues with very little. I daresay
      there are many things known to your London ladies that I am ignorant of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may thank God for that,&rdquo; muttered her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there are those in London, saving your lordship, who say I am not a
      lady, I will box their ears for them an they make slighting remarks in my
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most unladylike argument! The tongue and not the hand is the Court
      lady&rsquo;s defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can use my tongue too, if need be, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have had evidence of it, my girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth used her fists, and surely she was a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often had my doubts of it. However, hereafter you must be educated
      as doth become a daughter of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be pleased to obey any commands my father places on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was interrupted by a servant throwing open the door,
      crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty the King!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sprang instantly to her feet, while her father rose more slowly,
      assisting himself with his hands on the arms of the chair.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;MAJESTY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was more of
      hurry than of kingly dignity in the entrance of Charles. The handsome face
      was marred by an imperious querulousness that for the moment detracted
      from its acknowledged nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strafford,&rdquo; he cried impatiently, &ldquo;I have been kept waiting. Servants are
      at this moment searching palace and park for you. Where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the forest, your Majesty. I am deeply grieved to learn that you
      needed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never needed you more than now. Are you ready to travel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford&rsquo;s gloomy face almost lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the instant, your Majesty,&rdquo; he replied with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. I trust your malady is alleviated, in some measure at
      least; still I know that sickness has never been a bar to duty with you.
      Yet I ask no man to do what I am not willing to do myself for the good of
      the State, and I shall be shortly on the road at your heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither, your Majesty?&rdquo; asked the Earl with falling countenance, for it
      was to Ireland he desired to journey, and he knew the King had no
      intention of moving toward the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London, of course; a short stent over bad roads. But if you are ailing
      and fear the highway, a barge on the river is at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London!&rdquo; echoed the Earl, something almost akin to dismay in his tone.
      &ldquo;I had hoped your Majesty would order me to Ireland, which I assure your
      Majesty has been somewhat neglected of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; exclaimed the King brusquely, &ldquo;I know your anxiety in that
      quarter. A man ever thinks that task the most important with which he
      intimately deals, but my position gives me a view over the whole realm,
      and the various matters of State assume their just proportions in my eyes;
      their due relations to each other. Ireland is well enough, but it is the
      heart and not the limbs of the empire that requires the physicians&rsquo; care.
      Parliament has opened badly, and is like to give trouble unless treated
      with a firm hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand of the Earl appeared anything but firm. It wavered as it sought
      the support of the chair&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I your Majesty&rsquo;s permission to be seated? I am not well,&rdquo; Strafford
      said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely,&rdquo; cried the King, himself taking a chair. &ldquo;I am deeply
      grieved to see you so unwell; but a journey to London is a small matter
      compared with a march upon Dublin, which is like to have killed you in
      your present condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, your Majesty, the smaller journey may well have the more fatal
      termination,&rdquo; murmured the Earl; but the King paid no attention to the
      remark, for his wandering eye now caught sight of a third in the
      conference, which brought surprised displeasure to his brow. The girl was
      standing behind the high back of the chair in which she had been seated,
      in a gloomy angle where the firelight which played so plainly on the King
      and Strafford did not touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, whom have we here? The flippant prophet of the forest, or
      my eyes deceive me! How comes this girl in my palace, so intimate with my
      Lord Strafford, who seemed to meet her as a stranger but yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slumbering suspicion of Charles was aroused, and he glanced from one
      to the other in haughty questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met her until I encountered her in the forest when I had the
      honour to accompany your Majesty. To-day, as I walked with De Courcy and
      others, there came a second accosting from her, as unexpected as the
      first. The girl craved private speech with me, which I somewhat
      reluctantly granted. The upshot is, she brings me proof, which I cannot
      deny, that she is my eldest daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eldest daughter!&rdquo; cried the King, amazed. &ldquo;Is your family then so
      widely scattered, and so far unknown to you, that such a claimant may
      spring up at any moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was married privately to the daughter of Sir John Warburton.
      Circumstances separated me from my wife, and although her father curtly
      informed me of her death he said nothing of issue. There was a feud
      between us,&mdash;entirely on his part,&mdash;I had naught against him. It
      seems he has been dead this year past, and my daughter, getting news of
      her father among Sir John&rsquo;s papers, comes thus southward to make inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fall into good fortune, my girl. Your extraordinary claim is most
      readily allowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances, finding nothing to say, kept silence and bowed her head to the
      King, whom she had regarded throughout with rapt attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where got you your gift of prophecy? Is prescience hereditary, and has
      your father&rsquo;s mantle already fallen on your shoulders? He is my best
      friend, you said, and I my worst enemy. God&rsquo;s truth, Madam, you did not
      lack for boldness, but the force of the flattery of your father is
      lessened by my knowledge of your relationship, hitherto concealed from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty, it has hitherto been concealed from myself,&rdquo; said the Earl
      wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the girl no tongue? It wagged freely enough in the forest. Come,
      masquerader, what have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty, I humbly crave your pardon. The words I used yesterday were
      not mine, but those of a gipsy in the north, who told me I was the
      daughter of the Earl of Strafford at a time when such a tale seemed so
      absurd that I laughed at her for connecting my name of Wentworth with one
      so exalted as the Earl of Strafford. Later, when I received proof that
      such indeed was the case, her words returned to me. I had no right to use
      them in your august presence, but the entourage of the Lord Strafford
      prevented my meeting him; thus, baffled, I sought to intercept him in the
      forest, and was willing to use any strategy that might turn his attention
      toward me, in the hope of getting a private word with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you had a tongue. Well, it matters little what you said; your
      mission seems to have been successful. Do not think I placed any weight
      upon your words, be they gipsy-spoken or the outcome of a spirit of
      mischief. My Lord Strafford, you will to London then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will consult with you there to-morrow. And have no fear; for on my oath
      as a man, on my honour as a king, I will protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King rose and left the room as abruptly as he had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Strafford lay back in his chair, seemingly in a state of
      collapse. The girl looked on him in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo; she asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call a servant. Tell him to order a coach prepared at once, and see that
      it is well horsed, for I would have the journey as short as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, you are in no condition of health to travel to London. I will go
      to the King and tell him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do that I requested you, and trouble me not with counsel. There is enough
      of woman&rsquo;s meddling in this business already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances obeyed her father&rsquo;s instructions without further comment, then
      came and sat in her place again. The Earl roused himself, endeavouring to
      shake off his languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of the King?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man corroded with selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut! Such things are not to be spoken in the precincts of a Court.
      No, nor thought. He is not a selfish monarch, other than all monarchs are
      selfish, but&mdash;&mdash;discussion on such a theme is fruitless, and I
      must be nearing my dotage to begin it. I am far from well, Frances, and
      so, like the infirm, must take to babbling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fear Parliament, my lord? How can it harm you when you have the
      favour of the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear nothing, my girl, except foolish unseen interference; interference
      that may not be struck at or even hinted against. Did they teach you the
      history of France in your school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then study it as you grow older; I&rsquo;ll warrant you&rsquo;ll find it interesting
      enough. Ruined by women. Ruined by women. Seven civil wars in seventeen
      years, and all because of viperish, brainless women. Well, we have one of
      the breed here in England, and God help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Queen, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Curses on it, will you be as outspoken as another of your sex is
      spiteful and subtle? Mend your manners, hussy, and guard your tongue.
      Could you not see you spoke too freely to the King a moment since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not sorry, but cautious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford fell into a reverie, and there was silence in the room until the
      servant entered and announced that the coach was ready, whereupon his
      master rose unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;will you not eat or drink before you depart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then, looking sharply at his daughter, he inquired, &ldquo;Are you
      hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring hither some refreshments, whatever is most ready to hand, and a
      measure of hot spiced wine. I had forgotten your youth, Frances, thinking
      all the world was old with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the refection came, she ate but sparingly, despite her proclamation,
      but coaxed him to partake and to drink a cup of wine. He ordered a woman&rsquo;s
      cloak brought for her, which, when she had thrown it over her shoulders,
      he himself fastened at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, when the cloak enveloped her, &ldquo;that will protect you
      somewhat, for the night grows cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford himself was wrapped in warm furs, and thus together they went
      down the stairs to the court, now dimly lighted. A cavalier, who seemed to
      have been standing in wait for them, stepped out from the shadow of the
      arches, and Frances recognized the French spark whom she had so frankly
      characterized earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; protested De Courcy jauntily, &ldquo;you have your comrades at a
      disadvantage. You have captured the woodland nymph, and, I hear, propose
      spiriting her away to London. I do protest &rsquo;t is most unfair to
      those who are thus left behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Strafford, with severity, pausing in his walk, &ldquo;I would have
      you know that the lady to whom you refer is the Lady Frances Wentworth, my
      eldest daughter, ever to be spoken of with respect by high and low. Native
      and foreign shall speak otherwise at their distinct peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman pulled off his bonnet with an impressive sweep that brushed
      its ample feather lightly on the stones. He bent his body in a low
      obeisance that threatened, were it not so acrobatically accomplished, to
      pitch him forward on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I congratulate your lordship on finding so rare a daughter, rather
      than offer my felicitations to the lady in the attainment of so
      distinguished a father, it is because I am filled with envy of any man who
      acquires a companionship so charming. My lady, may I have the honour of
      escorting you to the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shrank closer to her father and made no reply. On the other hand
      the father offered no objection, but returned&mdash;rather stiffly, it is
      true&mdash;the bow of the foreigner, and De Courcy, taking this as an
      acceptance, tripped daintily by the girl&rsquo;s side, chattering most amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear on the highest authority that our sovereign lady is tired of
      Hampton, and that we are all to be on the march for London again;
      to-morrow, they tell me. London delights me not. &rsquo;T is a grimy
      city, but if, as I suspect, a new star of beauty is to arise there, then
      &rsquo;t will be indeed the centre of refulgence, to which worshippers of
      loveliness will hasten as pilgrims to a shrine. I take it, my lord, that
      you will introduce your daughter to the Court, and hide her no longer in
      the cold and envious northland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter has already been presented to his Majesty, and doubtless will
      take the place at Court to which her birth entitles her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to which her grace and charm no less lay claim. I hope to be present
      when the lady is greeted by the Queen we both adore. The meeting of the
      Lily of France with the Rose of England will be an occasion to be sung by
      poets; would that I were a minstrel to do justice to the theme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their arrival at the carriage, with its four impatient horses,
      postillion-ridden, saved Strafford the effort of reply had he intended
      such. He seated himself in the closed vehicle, and his daughter sprang
      nimbly in beside him, ignoring the proffered aid of De Courcy, who stood
      bowing and bending with much courtesy, and did not resume his bonnet until
      the coach lurched on its lumbering way, preceded and followed by a guard
      of horsemen, for the Earl of Strafford always travelled in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was said by either until the jingling procession was well clear of
      the park, when the girl, with a shudder, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loathe that scented fop!&rdquo;&mdash;then, seeming to fear a reproof for her
      outspoken remark, added, &ldquo;I know I should not say that, but I cannot see
      what you have in common with such a creature that you are civil to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement her father laughed slightly, the first time she had heard
      him do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we travel, Frances, safe out of earshot, you may loathe whom you
      please, but, as I have warned you, &rsquo;t is sometimes unsafe to give
      expression to your feelings within four walls. I may find little in common
      with any man, least of all with such as De Courcy, whom I take to be as
      false as he is fair; but there is slight use in irritating a wasp whom you
      cannot crush. Wait till he is under my hand, then I shall crush
      ruthlessly; but the time is not yet. He has the ear of the Queen, and she
      has the ear of her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, what reason have you to suspect that the Queen moves against you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One reason is that I am this moment journeying east when I would be
      travelling west. In truth, my girl, you seem resolved unconsciously to
      show you are your father&rsquo;s daughter with that uncurbed tongue of yours,
      for a lack of lying is like to be my undoing. If I had told the King I
      must to London, &rsquo;t is most like we were now on our way to Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it may be the King himself who thus orders you contrarywise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the King. He is not, as you think, selfish, but ever gives ear to
      the latest counsellor. He is weak and thinks himself strong; a most
      dangerous combination. With trembling hand he speaks of its firmness. Now,
      a weak monarch or a strong monarch matters little; England has been
      blessed with both and has survived the blessing; but a monarch who is.
      weak and strong by turns courts disaster. &lsquo;War with the Scots,&rsquo; says the
      King. He will smite them with a firm hand. Very good; a most desirable
      outcome. But our captains, promoted by a woman&rsquo;s whisper and not by their
      own merit, trust to the speed of their horses rather than the ingenuity of
      military skill, and so escape the Scots. Our army is scattered, and there
      is panic in Whitehall. I am called, for God&rsquo;s sake, from Ireland, and I
      come scarce able, through illness, to sit my horse. I gather round me men
      of action and brain, and send Madam&rsquo;s favourites to the rear, where they
      will gallop in any case as soon as the enemy shows front. What is the
      result? A portion of our Scottish friends are cut up, and those whose legs
      are untouched are on the run. Very good again. The dogs are rushing for
      their kennels. What happens? An added title for me, you might suppose. Not
      so. A censure comes post haste from London. &lsquo;Leave the Scots alone, the
      King is negotiating with them.&rsquo; In the face of victory he embraces defeat.
      A peace is made that I know nothing of; all their demands are granted, as
      if they had environed London! I am left like a fool, with a newly inspired
      army and no enemy. They termed it &lsquo;negotiating&rsquo; in London, but I call it
      &lsquo;surrender.&rsquo; If you intend to submit, keep the sword in its sheath and
      submit. If you draw the sword, fight till you are beaten, then submit when
      there is nothing else to do. God&rsquo;s name! they did not need to hale me from
      Ireland, where I had wrenched peace from chaos, to encompass a disgraceful
      retreat! Even De Courcy could have managed that with much greater urbanity
      than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think the Queen is responsible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else? Her generals were disgraced and whipped like dogs. Unvaliant in
      the battle-field, they are powerful in the ante-chamber, and their whines
      arise in the ears of the Lily of France, who would rather see her husband
      wrecked than saved by me. But I was never one to hark back on things that
      are past. My duty was to save the King from future errors. One more grave
      mistake lay open to him, and that was the summoning of Parliament at such
      a moment. It was a time for action, not for words. &lsquo;If you meant to
      concede, why did you not concede without bloodshed?&rsquo; was a question sure
      to be asked; a question to which there could be no answer. Very well. I
      accepted in humbleness the censure that should have been placed on other
      shoulders, and sent back by the courier who brought it a message imploring
      the King to call no Parliament until we had time to set our house in order
      and face Lords and Commons with good grace. I then arranged my command so
      that if the Scots broke forth again they would meet some examples of
      military science, and not view only the coat-tails of the Queen&rsquo;s
      favourite generals. No reply coming from the King, I mounted my horse,
      and, with only one follower, set forth for London. Pushing on through
      darkness on the second night of my journey, I heard the galloping of a
      horse behind me, and drew rein, fully expecting that the greedy Scots,
      asking more than could be allowed, had taken to the field again. &lsquo;Good
      friend,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;what news, that you ride so fast?&rsquo; &lsquo;Great news,&rsquo; he
      answered, breathless. &lsquo;A Parliament is summoned, and as I am an elected
      member I ride in haste. Please God, before the month is done we have
      Strafford&rsquo;s head in our hands and off his treacherous shoulders.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave utterance to a little cry of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;t was nothing but some braggart countryman, knowing not to
      whom he spoke so freely, and big in the importance of his membership,
      dashing on to London, thinking the world rested on his speed; and thus I
      learned how my advice had been scorned. When I met the King he was all
      panic and regret. He had conjured up the Devil easily enough, but knew not
      how to allay him. He bewailed his mistakes and called himself the most
      unfortunate of monarchs, eager to please, yet constantly offending. He was
      in a contrite mood, but that soon changed. &rsquo;T is my head they
      want,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Do with it as you please. If it is useless to you, toss it
      to them; if useful, then send me to Ireland, where I shall be out of the
      way, yet ready to afford you what service lies in my power.&rsquo; He swore he
      would concede them nothing. He was done with unappreciated complaisance,
      and now it was to be the firm hand. They should learn who was ruler of the
      realm. He gave me permission to return to my post. I was his only friend;
      his truest counsellor. That was yesterday. You heard him speak to-day. It
      is still the firm hand, but I must to London. There indeed exists a firm
      hand, but it is concealed, and so directed by hatred of me that it may
      project the avalanche that will overwhelm us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you do in London?&rdquo; asked his daughter in an awed whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows! Had I the untrammelled ordering of events, I would strike
      terror into Parliament, as I struck terror into the Scots or the Irish,
      but&mdash;&mdash;but if, after that, there was a similar sneaking
      underhand surrender, why then the countryman would have my head, as he
      hoped. I fear there are troublous times before us. This alternate grip of
      the firm hand, and offering of open-palmed surrender, each at the wrong
      time, is like the succeeding hot and cold fits of an ague; &rsquo;T will
      rend the patient asunder if long continued. Frances, be ever a womanly
      woman. Never meddle with politics. Leave sword and State to men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tired with long converse and the jolting of the vehicle, Strafford sank
      into a troubled sleep, from which he was at last awakened by the stopping
      of the carriage in front of his town house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;PROPOSAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rances Wentworth
      crossed the threshold of her father&rsquo;s house with more trepidation than she
      had experienced on entering the palace of the King at Hampton Court. Here
      probably awaited a stepmother with her children, and Frances doubted the
      cordiality of the approaching reception. The ever-increasing fear of her
      father, a sentiment felt by nearly all those who encountered him, mingled
      with hatred, usually, on their part, but with growing affection on hers,
      prevented the putting of the question whether or no Lady Strafford was now
      in London. Their journey together had been silent since he ceased the
      exposition of the difficulties which surrounded him,&mdash;a man whom all
      England regarded as being paramount in the kingdom, yet in reality baffled
      and almost at bay. Looking back over the day now drawn to its close, she
      marvelled at her own courage in approaching him as she had done,
      light-heartedly and confident. Were her task to be re-enacted her mind
      misgave her that she would not possess the temerity to carry it through,
      with her new knowledge of the man. Yet if Strafford were hated in the
      three kingdoms, he seemed to be well liked in that little despotism, his
      home, where servants clustered round, for each of whom he had a kind word.
      Whether they knew of his coming or not, the house was prepared for his
      reception, fires blazing, and a table spread in the room to which he
      conducted his daughter. Outside, the night was cold and damp, and the
      inward warmth struck gratefully upon the senses of the travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Jarrett,&rdquo; said the Earl to his housekeeper, who looked with wonder
      at the new-comer he had brought, &ldquo;have you aught of woman&rsquo;s trappings that
      will fit my daughter here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and as you will be consumed by curiosity until you know how it comes
      so, I will add that she is newly found, having lived till now with her
      grandfather in the North, and is the child of my second wife, Frances
      Warburton, married by me some seventeen years since. Any further
      particulars my daughter herself will supply, if you question shrewdly, as
      I doubt not you will; but postpone inquiry, I beg of you, until to-morrow.
      Meanwhile robe her as best you may with the materials at hand, and that
      quickly, for I wish her company at supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances was then spirited away to the apartment assigned to her, and when
      presently she reappeared she was costumed more to her father&rsquo;s liking than
      had hitherto been the case. They sat down together to the meal that had
      hastily been prepared for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, if I remember aright what you said, is your birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it difficult for you to say &lsquo;Father&rsquo;? My other children pronounce the
      word glibly enough. When you and I first met, and even since then, you
      seemed not backward in speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I find myself more afraid of you than I was at the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford smiled, but answered: &ldquo;I assure you there is no need. I may be
      an implacable enemy, but I have the reputation of being as staunch a
      friend. So to-morrow is your birthday, saddened by the fact that it is
      also the date of your mother&rsquo;s death. That is a loss for which a man in my
      onerous position cannot even partially atone, but it is a loss which you
      perhaps have not keenly felt. It seems heartless to speak thus, but the
      fact remains that we cannot deeply deplore the departure of what we have
      never enjoyed. One thing I can covenant; that you shall not hereafter know
      the lack of money, which is something to promise in a city of shops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never known the lack of it, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you indeed been so fortunate? Well, there again you bear a
      resemblance to your father. Sir John was reputed comfortably off in the
      old days, and I infer he harboured his wealth, a somewhat difficult task
      in times gone by. Are you then his heir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of two, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! I had momentarily forgotten the brother who favours his
      grandfather rather than his sire. I am like to be over-busy to-morrow to
      attend the mart of either mercer or goldsmith, and if I did, I should not
      know what to purchase that would please you. But here are all the birthday
      presents of London in embryo, needing but your own touch to bring forth
      the full blossom of perfect satisfaction. Midas, they say, transmuted
      everything he fingered into gold, and it is the province of your sex to
      reverse the process. Buy what catches your fancy, and flatter your father
      by naming it his gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held forward a very well filled purse, through whose meshes the bright
      gold glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I do not need it, and you have been very kind to me as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! We all desire more than we can obtain. It is my wish that you
      take it; in any case it is but part payment of a debt long running and
      much overdue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fearing again to refuse, she accepted the proffered purse with evident
      reluctance, now standing opposite her father, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very tired and shall not rise early to-morrow. Do not wait breakfast
      for me. Good-night, daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although he had said the last conventional words of the day, he still
      stood there as if loath to retire, then he stooped and kissed her on the
      lips, ruffling her black, wayward, curly hair so like his own in texture,
      colour, and freedom from restraint, and patting her affectionately on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be afraid of me from this time forward, child?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Indeed, Frances, I grow superstitious as I become older, and I look on
      your strange arrival as in some measure providential. There is none of my
      own kind to whom I can speak freely, as I did to you in the carriage; my
      daughters&mdash;my other daughters&mdash;are too young. My Lady Strafford
      takes much interest in her garden, and dislikes this London house and this
      London town, for which small blame is to be imputed to her. In you, a
      man&rsquo;s courage is added to a woman&rsquo;s wit, and who knows but my daughter may
      prove the reinforcement I lacked in my baffling fight with the unseen. Do
      you speak French, my girl, or are you as ignorant of the language of that
      country as of its history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak it but haltingly, sir, though I was taught its rudiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must amend that. It is to our tongue what the thin rapier is to the
      broadsword. Good lack! there was a time when one language served the
      English, yet great deeds were done and great poems written; but that time
      is past now. I must get you a master. I have likely used the broadsword
      overmuch, but who knows? You may be the rapier by my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall not disappoint you, sir, though I am but a country maid,
      with some distrust of this great city and its Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;City and Court are things we get speedily accustomed to. Well, again
      good-night, sweetheart, and sleep soundly. I see those fine eyes are
      already heavy with slumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But sleep came not so quickly as he surmised to the eyes he had
      complimented. The day had been too full of rapid change and tense
      excitement. The strange transformation of the present, and the dim,
      troubled vista of the future which opened out to her, cherished thought
      and discouraged slumber. Was it possible that she was thus to be
      transplanted, was to stand by the side of the greatest man in England, his
      acknowledged daughter, his welcome aid? God grant she might not fail him,
      if he had real need of her. And so she planned the days to come. She would
      be as subtle as the craftiest. She would cover all dislikes as the cloak
      had covered her, and her lips should smile though her heart revolted. Her
      tongue must measure what it said, and all rural bluntness should
      disappear. She slipped from these meditations into a hazy, bewildering
      conflict; her father, somehow, was in a danger that she could not fathom,
      she lacking power to get to him, restrained by invisible bonds, not
      knowing where he was, although he called to her. Then it seemed there was
      a turmoil in the street, a cry for help, a groan, and silence, and next
      Mrs. Jarrett was moving about the room and had drawn curtains that let in
      a grey, misty daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my father yet arisen?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good lack! no, your ladyship, nor will he for hours to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s head fell back on her pillow, and she said dreamily, &ldquo;I thought
      there had been trouble of some sort, and men fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, your ladyship, and so there was, a rioting going on all the
      night. I think the citizens of London are gone mad, brawling in the street
      at hours when decent folk should be in their beds. &rsquo;T is said that
      this new Parliament is the cause, but how or why I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the Earl of Strafford did not quit his chamber until noontide, he
      was undoubtedly concerned with affairs that demanded attention from the
      greatest minister of State. There were constant runnings to and fro,
      messengers despatched and envoys received, with the heavy knocker of the
      door constantly a-rap. It was two hours after mid-day when Strafford sent
      for his daughter, and she followed his messenger to the library, where she
      found her father in his chair beside a table, although he was equipped for
      going forth from the house. There had been seated before him De Courcy,
      but the young man rose as she entered and greeted her with one of his
      down-reaching bows which set her a-quake lest he should fall forward on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;I am about to set out for Parliament, and it
      may be late before I return. Yet I think you shall sup with me at seven if
      all goes well and debate becomes not too strenuous; but do not wait in
      case I should be detained. I counsel you not to leave the house to-day,
      for there seem to be many brawlers on the streets. Any shopman will be
      pleased to wait upon you and bring samples of his wares, so send a servant
      for those you wish to consult. My friend De Courcy, here, begs the favour
      of some converse with you, and speaks with my approval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford looked keenly at the girl, and her heart thrilled as she read
      the unspoken message with quick intuition. He had some use for De Courcy,
      and she must be suave and diplomatic. Thus already she was her father&rsquo;s
      ally; an outpost in his vast concerns now committed to her. The young man
      saw nothing of this, for he had eyes only for the girl. The broad rim of
      his feathered hat was at his smirking lips, and his gaze of admiration was
      as unmistakable as it was intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I shall obey you in all things, and hope to win your commendation,&rdquo;
       said Frances with inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure of the latter in any case, my child,&rdquo; replied Strafford,
      rising. &ldquo;And now, De Courcy, I think we understand each other, and I may
      rely upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the death, my lord,&rdquo; cried the young man, with another of his courtly
      genuflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us hope &rsquo;t will not be necessary quite so far as that. I
      bid you good-day. To-morrow at this hour I shall look for a report from
      you. For the moment, good-bye, my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the Earl quit of the room, and the door closed behind him,
      than De Courcy, with an impetuous movement that startled the girl, flung
      himself at her feet. Her first impulse was to step quickly back, but she
      checked it and stood her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, divine Frances!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how impatiently I have waited for this
      rapt moment, when I might declare to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I beg of you to arise. &rsquo;T is not seemly you should demean
      yourself thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is seemly that the whole world should grovel at your feet, my
      lady of the free forest; for all who look upon you must love you, and for
      me, who have not the cold heart of this northern people, I adore you, and
      do here avow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take me at a disadvantage, sir. I have never been spoken to thus. I
      am but a child and unaccustomed. Only sixteen this very day. I ask you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most beauteous nymph! How many grand ladies of our Court would give all
      they possess to make such confession truly. Aye, the Queen herself. I do
      assure you, sweetest, such argument will never daunt a lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you, sir, to arise. My father may return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he will not. And if he did, &rsquo;t would pleasure him to see my
      suit advancing. I loved you from the first moment I beheld you; and though
      you used me with contumely, yet I solaced my wounded heart that &rsquo;t
      was me you noticed, and me only, even though your glance was tinged with
      scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding a situation that called for tact, she was unable to resist
      a touch of the linguistic rapier, and her eyes twinkled with suppressed
      merriment as she said, &ldquo;You forget, sir, that I also distinguished the
      keeper of the hounds with my regard;&rdquo; but, seeing he winced, she
      recollected her position and added, &ldquo;In truth, I was most churlishly rude
      in the forest, and I am glad you spoke of it, that I now have opportunity
      to beg your pardon very humbly. I have learned since then that you stand
      high in my dear father&rsquo;s regard, and indeed he chided me for my violence,
      as &rsquo;t was his duty to do by a wayward child.&rdquo; The gallant was
      visibly flattered by this tribute to his <i>amour propre</i>. He seized
      her hand and pressed his lips to it, the tremor which passed over her at
      this action being probably misinterpreted by his unquenchable vanity. The
      tension was relieved by a low roar from the street, a sound that had in it
      the menace of some wild beast roused to anger. It brought to the girl a
      reminiscence of her disturbed dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! What is it?&rdquo; she exclaimed, snatching away her hand and
      running to the window. Her suitor rose to his feet, daintily dusted the
      knees of his silken wear with a film of lace that did duty for a
      handkerchief, and followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street below was packed with people howling round a carriage that
      seemed blocked by the press. The stout coachman, gorgeous in splendid
      livery, had some ado to restrain the spirited horses, maddened and
      prancing with the interference and the outcry. Cudgels were shaken aloft
      in the air, and there were shouts of &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tyrant!&rdquo; and other epithets so degrading that Frances put her hands to
      her ears in horrified dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are they threatening so fiendishly?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your father&rsquo;s carriage,&rdquo; answered De Courcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could make further inquiry there came up to them the cold,
      dominating tones of her father&rsquo;s voice, clear above that tumult,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout coachman laid about him with his whip, and the curses for the
      moment abandoned the head of Strafford to alight on that of the driver.
      The horses plunged fiercely into the crowd. The cruel progress changed the
      tenor of the cries, as if a wailing stop of a great organ had suddenly
      taken the place of the open diapason. The press was so great that those in
      front could not make for safety, and the disappearing coach was greeted
      with screams of terror and was followed by groans of agony. Men went down
      before it like ripe grain before a sickle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; moaned the girl, all color leaving her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It serves the dogs right,&rdquo; said De Courcy. &ldquo;How dare they block the way
      of a noble, and the chief Minister of State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot look on this,&rdquo; lamented Frances, shrinking back to the
      table, and leaning against it as one about to faint, forgetting her desire
      to avoid further demonstration from her companion, in the trepidation
      which followed the scene she had witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed they were most mercifully dealt with, those scullions. The King of
      France would have sent a troop of horse to sabre them back into their
      kennels. &lsquo;Strike through!&rsquo; cried his lordship, and, by God! &rsquo;t is a
      good phrase, most suitable motto for a coat of arms, a hand grasping a
      dagger above it. &lsquo;Strike through!&rsquo; I shall not forget it. But &rsquo;t
      was a softer and more endearing theme I wished to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I beseech your polite consideration. I am nigh distraught with what
      I have seen, and am filled with a fear of London. &rsquo;T is not the
      courtly city I expected to behold. I am not myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will at least bid me hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely, all of us may hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &rsquo;t was the last and only gift left in Pandora&rsquo;s casket, and
      London were grim indeed to be more bereft than the receptacle of that
      deceitful woman. May I make my first draught on Madam Pandora&rsquo;s box by
      hoping that I am to see you at this hour tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,&rdquo; gasped the girl faintly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;EXACTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> &lsquo;drizzling rain
      had set in and had driven the crowds from the streets. Frances drew a
      chair to the window of the library and sat there meditating on the strange
      events in which she was taking some small part, so different from the
      tranquil happenings of the district she had known all her life. She had
      imagined London a city of palaces facing broad streets, fanciedly, if not
      literally, paved with gold; a town of gaiety and laughter: and here was
      the reality, a cavernous, squalid, gloomy, human warren, peopled with
      murky demons bent on outrage of some sort, ill-natured and threatening. As
      the day waned, she saw that in spite of the rain the mob was collecting
      again, its atoms running hither and thither, calling to each other;
      bedraggled beings labouring under some common excitement. And now its roar
      came to her again, farther off than before,&mdash;a roar that chilled her
      while she listened, and the wave of sound this time seemed to have a
      fearful note of exultation in it. She wondered what had happened, and was
      anxious for her father if he were at the mercy of it. Mrs. Jarrett came
      into the room, followed by a man-servant, and also by one of her father&rsquo;s
      secretaries, as the woman whispered to the girl:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady, we must close the shutters and bar them tightly, for the
      ruffians are threatening again, and may be here in force at any moment, to
      stone the windows, as they have done before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary seated himself at the table and was arranging papers. The
      man-servant opened the windows, from which Frances drew back, and now the
      cries came distinctly to her. &ldquo;Death to Strafford!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the tyrant!&rdquo; &ldquo;To the block with the King&rsquo;s Earl!&rdquo; were some of
      the shouts she heard lustily called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I fear my father is in danger. Do you think they have him in their
      power, that they exult so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good Mrs. Jarrett, anxiety on her own honest face, soothed her young
      mistress, and the secretary came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not troubled, Madam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;While they cry &lsquo;To the block&rsquo; it shows
      they have not possession of his lordship&rsquo;s person, but hope to stir up
      rancour to his disfavour. While they shout for process of law, his
      lordship is safe, for the law is in his hands and in those of the King,
      whose behests he carries out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed a reasonable deduction, and it calmed the inquirer, although
      there remained to her disquietude the accent of triumph in the voice of
      the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death to Strafford!&rdquo; was the burden of the acclaim; but now one shouted,
      &ldquo;Justice on Strafford!&rdquo;&mdash;though his meaning was clearly the same as
      the others. There was no dissenting outcry, and this unanimous hatred so
      vehemently expressed terrified at least one listener. Why was her father
      so universally detested? What had he done? Stern he was, undoubtedly; but
      just, as his reception of herself had shown, and courteous to all to whom
      she heard him speak; yet the memory of that phrase &ldquo;Strike through!&rdquo;
       uttered with such ruthless coldness, haunted her memory, and she heard
      again the shrieks of those trampled under foot. It was an indication that
      what he had to do he did with all his might, reckless of consequence. If
      any occupied his path, the obstructor had to stand aside or go down, and
      such a course does not make for popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows being now shuttered and barred securely, and the tumult
      muffled into indistinct murmur, lights were brought in. Mrs. Jarrett urged
      the girl to partake of some refreshment, but Frances insisted on waiting
      for her father. The secretary, seeing her anxiety, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vollins went out some two hours ago to learn what was taking place,
      and I am sure if anything serious had happened he would have been here
      before now with tidings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Mr. Vollins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship&rsquo;s treasurer, Madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the words were uttered, the door opened, disclosing John Vollins, the
      expression of whose serious, clean-shaven face gave little promise of
      encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Mr. Vollins? The mob seems rampant again,&rdquo; spoke up the
      secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disquieting news, or I am misled. The rumour is everywhere believed that
      his lordship was arrested in Parliament this afternoon, and is now in
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! &rsquo;T would be a breach of privilege. In Parliament! It
      cannot be. Did you visit the precincts of Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man can get within a mile of it, the mass of people is so great. It
      seems as if all London were concentrated there, and one is swept hither
      and thither in the crush like a straw on the billows of the sea. Progress
      is out of the question except in whatever direction impulse sways the mob.
      There are so many versions of what is supposed to have happened that none
      can sift the truth. It is said that Parliament, behind closed doors,
      impeached his lordship, and that when he demanded entrance to his place he
      was arrested by order of the two Houses acting conjointly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if that were true,&mdash;and it seems incredible,&mdash;the King
      can liberate him at a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say even the King and Court have fled, and that hereafter Parliament
      will be supreme; but one cannot believe a tithe of what is flying through
      the streets this night. The people are mad,&mdash;stark mad.&rdquo; Mrs. Jarrett
      hovered about the young lady in case an announcement so fraught with dread
      to all of them should prove too much for her; but Frances was the most
      collected of any there. &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;&rsquo;T will
      be but a temporary inconvenience to my father which he will make little
      of. He has committed no crime, and may face with fortitude the judgment of
      his peers, certain of triumphant acquittal. He is in London by command of
      the King, his master, and his Majesty will see to it, should all else
      fail, that he suffers not for his obedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion was so reasonable that it had the effect of soothing the
      apprehensions of all who heard it, and, young as she was, Frances seemed
      to assume a place of authority in the estimation of those present, which
      was to stand her in good stead later in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headless household, barricaded in, with frequent testimony of public
      execration in the ominous impact of missiles flung against doors and
      shutters outside, went about its accustomed way in an anxious, halfhearted
      manner, continually on the <i>qui vive</i>. As the girl wandered aimlessly
      about the large house, nothing gave her so vivid a sense of insecurity as
      the dim figure of the secretary seated in the ill-lighted hall, with his
      cheek against the front door, listening for any hint of his master&rsquo;s
      approach, ready to undo bar and bolt with all speed and admit him at the
      first sign of necessity; ready, also, to defend the portal should the door
      be broken in by the populace, a disaster which the blows rained against it
      sometimes seemed to predict, followed by breathless periods of
      nonmolestation. The secretary&rsquo;s sword lay across his knee, and, like a
      phantom army, backs against the wall, stood in silence, similarly armed,
      the menservants of the household. The one scant twinkling light had been
      placed on a table, and a man sat beside it, his pale face more strongly
      illumined than any other of that ghostly company, radiant against a
      background of darkness. He was prepared to cover the light instantly, or
      to blow it out, at a signal from his leader the secretary, seated in the
      chair by the strong oaken door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after nine o&rsquo;clock, during a lull in the tempest, that there was a
      rap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; asked the secretary through the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A messenger from the Court,&rdquo; was the reply. Frances had come up the hall
      on hearing the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo; demanded the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Courcy. Open quickly, I beg of you. The mob has surged down the
      street, but it may return at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open,&rdquo; said Frances with decision, and the secretary obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy came in, unrecognizable at first because of the cloak that
      enveloped him. The door was secured behind him, and he flung his cloak to
      one of the men standing there. His gay plumage was somewhat ruffled, and
      the girl never thought she would be so heartily glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that my father is sent to the Tower?&rdquo; were her first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mademoiselle; but he is in custody, arrested by order of Parliament,
      and at this moment detained in the house of James Maxwell, Keeper of the
      Black Rod, who took his sword from him and is responsible for his safety.
      &rsquo;T is said he will be taken to the Tower to-morrow; but they reckon
      not on the good will of some of us who are his friends, and they forget
      the power of the King. Mon Dieu! What a night, and what a people! One
      walks the streets at the risk of life and garments. I was never so mauled
      about, and despaired of reaching this door. I&rsquo;ve been an hour outside
      screeching &lsquo;Death to Strafford!&rsquo; with the rest of them, else I were torn
      limb from limb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances frowned, but said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were the circumstances of my father&rsquo;s arrest? What do they charge
      against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows what the indictment is; chiefly that he is Strafford, I think.
      He entered the House of Lords this afternoon, and walked with customary
      dignity to his place, but was curtly ordered to withdraw until he was sent
      for, as the Commons were at that moment enunciating their formula against
      him. He withdrew in the face of this loud protest, and at last, being
      recalled, stood before them; was commanded to kneel, which with some
      hesitation he did, while the articles to his disparagement were read from
      the Woolsack. He was then dismissed, and, once in the outer room again,
      the Black Rod demanded his sword, and so conducted him, under restraint,
      to a carriage; no man of all then present capping to him, although they
      had been obsequious enough when he entered. A scurvy lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you among them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I; I give you the account as &rsquo;t was told to me, but had I been
      in that contemptible company, my hat would have gone lower than ever
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen my father, then; he has sent no message by you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen him, but I come to crave a few words with you in
      private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you must excuse me. I am so tense with anxiety about my father, I
      can think of naught else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is on that subject I wish to discourse. He has set in train a
      series of events in which I hoped to aid him, but it is like to go awry
      through this most unlooked-for arrest. That is why I was here this
      morning, and the commission was to have been completed to-morrow. Did he
      say anything to you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard all he said to me to-day. I saw him for but a moment, and that
      in your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped his lordship made a confidant of you, so my mission were the
      easier of accomplishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it has to do with his welfare, I am ready to confer with you. Come
      with me to the library.&rdquo; But before they could quit the hall, they were
      aware that another was taking advantage of the lull in the street to seek
      entrance to the mansion. Frances paused to learn the result. This time it
      was an envoy from Strafford himself, and he brought a letter addressed to
      &ldquo;Mistress Frances Wentworth.&rdquo; She opened and read the note with eager
      anticipation, forgetting, for the moment, all who were standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweetheart:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard before this what hath befallen me; yet trust thou in the
      goodness of God that my enemies shall do me no hurt. I am troubled that
      you should be in London at this time, where I can be of no help to you. It
      would please me to know that you were safe in the home where you have
      lived until this present time. Think not that you can assist me other than
      by obeying, for I trust in God and the King, and in the assurance that I
      am innocent of the charges malice hath brought against me. Therefore be in
      no way alarmed, but betake yourself straightway to the North, there to
      wait with your brother, as heretofore, until I send a message for you,
      which I hope to do right speedily. Travel in comfort and security, and
      take with you such of my household as will secure both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My treasurer, John Vollins, will give you all money you require, and this
      letter is his assurance to fulfil your wishes in this and every respect.
      Trust in God; give way to no fear; but bear yourself as my daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman folded the letter without a word, except to the secretary,
      to whom she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father writes in good confidence, seeing no cause for alarm, having
      assurance of his innocence and faith in God and the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she led the way to the library, followed by De Courcy, hat in hand.
      Vollins arose and left them together, whereupon the Frenchman, with some
      slight hesitation, possibly remembering a different plea on that spot a
      few hours before, began his recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning his lordship, your honoured father, requested my assistance
      in a business which he thought I was capable of bringing to a satisfactory
      conclusion. It concerned a highly placed personage, whom it is perhaps
      improper for me to name, and perhaps unnecessary for me to particularize
      further. His lordship&rsquo;s intention was to present this exalted lady with
      some gift which she would value for its intrinsic worth no less than its
      artistic quality, and, as he professed himself no judge of such,
      preferring to depend upon the well-known taste of my nation in delicate
      articles of merit, also so far complimenting me as to believe that I
      could, in suitable manner and phrase, present this token to the gracious
      accepter of it, he desired my intervention, and I promised so to pleasure
      him to the best of my poor abilities. On leaving you this morning I made
      selection of the gift, and furthermore gave hint to the recipient of its
      intended presentation,&mdash;a hint, I may say, which was received with
      palpable delight. Judge, then, my consternation when I heard of the Earl&rsquo;s
      arrest, for he had promised to pay me the money to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused, his listener pondering with her eyes on the floor.
      She had such a deep distrust of him, and was so well aware of the
      prejudice, that she struggled against it, praying for an unbiased mind.
      Yet much that he had said coincided with certain things she knew,&mdash;her
      father&rsquo;s desire that the Queen should cease from meddling in affairs of
      State to his disadvantage and theirs; his seeming friendship for De
      Courcy, although he despised him; his intention that she should be civil
      to him; his disclaimer of all knowledge regarding what a woman valued in a
      gift when he presented her with a full purse the night before,&mdash;all
      these fitted with the Frenchman&rsquo;s story. The suppliant, scrutinizing her
      perplexed brow, seemed to fear that his chance of getting the money was
      vanishing, as he continued on the line most likely to incline her to
      favour his present demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I should not have troubled you in this matter did I not think
      that if the arrangement your father wished to make was important this
      morning, it is ten times more important to-night. Indeed, his liberty may
      depend upon it. I am well aware that it is open to me to say to the lady,
      &lsquo;Lord Strafford is in prison, and is unable to carry out his generous
      intentions,&rsquo; but I fear the deep disappointment will outweigh the force of
      the reasoning. Your charming sex is not always strictly logical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the sum agreed upon?&rdquo; asked Frances, looking suddenly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pounds in gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question had been sprung upon him, and he had answered without
      thought, but as he watched her resolute face a shade of disappointment
      passed over his own, as if of inward regret that he had not made the
      amount larger, should her determination prove his ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see that you get the money, if not to-night, at the time
      promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sent for Vollins and placed the case before him. The treasurer stood
      by the table, with inscrutable face and listened in silence, his somewhat
      furtive look bent on the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Monsieur De Courcy some scrap of writing in which my lord signifies
      that so considerable a payment is to be made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, this relates to business that is not put in writing
      between gentlemen,&rdquo; said the foreigner hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a gentleman, but merely the custodian of his lordship&rsquo;s purse. I
      dare not pay out gold without his lordship&rsquo;s warrant over his own
      signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands, as though he
      had washed them of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vollins,&rdquo; pleaded the girl eagerly, &ldquo;my father&rsquo;s life and liberty may
      depend on this disbursement. I will be your warrant. I have money of my
      own in the North, many times the sum I request you to pay. Should my
      father object, I will refund to you the thousand pounds; indeed I will
      remit it to you in any case, and my father need know nothing of this
      transaction, therefore you cannot be held in scath.&rdquo; Vollins shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not do it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His lordship is a very strict man of
      business and will hold me to account. He would forgive you, Madam, but
      would be merciless with me did I consent to so unheard of a proposal. I
      dare not count out a thousand pounds to the first man who steps from the
      street and asks for it, giving me his bare word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dispute my word, sir?&rdquo; demanded De Courcy, bristling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly not. I am but putting a case, as his lordship would undoubtedly
      put it to me were I to consent,&mdash;and what would be my answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have my word as well, Mr. Vollins,&rdquo; urged the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I beseech you to consider my position. I am but a servant. The
      money is not mine, or you were welcome to it. Yet why all this haste? His
      lordship can undoubtedly be communicated with tomorrow, and then a word or
      line from him is sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an adage, sir, of striking while the iron is hot; the iron may
      be cool enough by the time your scruples of legality are satisfied,&rdquo;
       warned De Courcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship can be communicated with; you are quite right, Mr. Vollins,&rdquo;
       cried Frances, remembering. &ldquo;He <i>has</i> communicated with me. I ask you
      to read this letter, and then to pay the thousand pounds required of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vollins read the letter with exasperating slowness, and said at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing here authorizing me to pay the gentleman a thousand
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, there is not. But my father says you are to pay me what moneys I
      require. I require at this moment a thousand pounds in gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money is for your safe conduct to the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read my father&rsquo;s letter more carelessly than I supposed, by the
      time you took. He says you are to fulfill my wishes in this and every
      respect. Do you still refuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madam. But I venture to advise you strongly against the payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your advice. I can certify that you have done your duty
      fully and faithfully. Will you kindly bring forth the gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vollins weighed the five bags of coin with careful exactitude and without
      further speech. De Courcy fastened them to his belt, then looked about him
      for his cloak, which he at last remembered to have left in the hall.
      Vollins called upon a servant to fetch it, taking it from him at the door.
      The Frenchman enveloped himself, and so hid his treasure. The cautious
      Vollins had prepared a receipt for him to sign, made out in the name of
      Frances Wentworth, but De Courcy demurred; it was all very well for the
      counting-house, he said, but not in the highest society. The Earl of
      Strafford would be the first to object to such a course, he insisted.
      Frances herself tore the paper in pieces, and said that a signature was
      not necessary, while Vollins made no further protest. She implored De
      Courcy, in a whispered adieu, to acquit faithfully the commission with
      which her father had entrusted him, and he assured her that he was now
      confident of success, thanking her effusively for the capable conduct of a
      difficult matter of diplomacy. Then, with a sweeping gesture of obeisance,
      he took his courteous departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vollins deferentially asked Frances to sign a receipt which he had
      written, acknowledging the payment of a thousand pounds, and to this
      document she hurriedly attached her signature.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;ORDEAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rances made her
      way to the North as her father had directed, and everywhere found the news
      of his arrest in advance of her; the country ablaze with excitement
      because of it. The world would go well once Strafford was laid low. He had
      deluded and misled the good King, as Buckingham did before him. Buckingham
      had fallen by the knife; Strafford should fall by the axe. Then the
      untrammelled King would rule well; quietness and industry would succeed
      this unhealthy period of fever and unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was appalled to meet everywhere this intense hatred of her
      father, and in her own home she was surrounded by it. Even her brother
      could not be aroused to sympathy, for he regarded his father not only as a
      traitor to his country, but as a domestic delinquent also, who had
      neglected and deserted his young wife, leaving her to die uncomforted
      without even a message from the husband for whom she had almost sacrificed
      her good name, bearing uncomplaining his absence and her father&rsquo;s wrath.
      During the winter Frances saw little of her brother. Thomas Wentworth was
      here and there riding the country, imagining, with the confidence of
      extreme youth, that he was mixing in great affairs, as indeed he was,
      although he was too young to have much influence in directing them. The
      land was in a ferment, and the wildest rumours were afloat. Strafford had
      escaped from the Tower, and had taken flight abroad, like so many of his
      friends who had now scattered in fear to France or to Holland. Again it
      was said the King&rsquo;s soldiers had attacked the Tower, liberated Strafford,
      and the Black Man was at the head of the wild Irish, resolved on the
      subjugation of England. Next, the Queen had called on France for aid, and
      an invasion was imminent. So there was much secret preparation, drilling
      and the concealing of arms against the time they should be urgently
      needed, and much galloping to and fro; a stirring period for the young, an
      anxious winter for the old, and Herbert Wentworth was in the thick of it
      all, mysteriously departing, unexpectedly returning, always more foolishly
      important than there was any occasion for. Yet had he in him the making of
      a man who was shortly to be tried by fire and steel, when greater wisdom
      crowned him than was at present the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the sinister rumours were contradicted by actual events; no
      French army crossed the Channel; the Irish did not rise; the grim Tower
      held Strafford secure in its iron grasp. Parliament seemed hesitating to
      strike, piling up accusations, collecting proof, but staying its hand.
      Everyone was loyal to the King, so grievously misled. The King could do no
      wrong, but woe to the Minister who could and did. So, this exciting winter
      passed and springtime came, ringing with news of Strafford&rsquo;s approaching
      trial. A stern resolve to be finally rid of him, proof or no proof, was in
      the air, tinctured with the fine silken hypocrisy that all should be done
      according to the law; that the axe should swing in rhythm with a solemn
      declaration of judgment legally rendered. And there was no man to say to
      the hesitating King, &ldquo;When that head falls, the brain of your government
      is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the letter she had received on the night of his arrest, the daughter
      heard no word from the father. Had he again forgotten, or were his
      messages intercepted? She did not know and was never to know. She had
      written to him, saying she had obeyed him, but there was no acknowledgment
      that her letter had reached its destination. Thus she waited and waited,
      gnawing impatience and dread chasing the rose from her cheeks, until she
      could wait no longer. Her horse and the southern road were at her
      disposal, with none to hinder, so she set forth for London, excusing
      herself for thus in spirit breaking her father&rsquo;s command, by the assurance
      that he had not forbidden her return. She avoided her father&rsquo;s mansion,
      knowing that Lady Strafford and her children were now in residence there,
      and went to the inn where she had formerly lodged. She soon learned that
      it was one thing to go to London, and quite another to obtain entrance to
      Westminster Hall, where the great trial, now approaching its end, was the
      fashionable magnet of the town. No place of amusement ever collected such
      audiences, and although money will overcome many difficulties, she found
      it could not purchase admission to the trial through any source that was
      available. Perhaps if she had been more conversant with the ways of the
      metropolis the golden key might have shot back the bolt, but with her
      present knowledge she was at her wit&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost in despair, a happy thought occurred to her. She wrote a note to
      John Vollins, her father&rsquo;s treasurer, and asked him to call upon her,
      which the good man did at the hour she set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father would be troubled to know you are in London, when he thinks
      you safe at home,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it, Mr. Vollins. I was in a fever of distraction and
      must have come even if I had walked. But my father need never know, and
      you remember he wrote that you were to help me.&rsquo; I wish a place in
      Westminster Hall and cannot attain it by any other means in my power than
      by asking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult of attainment. I advise you not to go there, for if his
      lordship happened to catch sight of you in that throng, who knows but at a
      critical moment it might unnerve him, for he is a man fighting with his
      back to the wall against implacable and unscrupulous enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not get me some station where I might look upon my father
      unseen by him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seats in the Hall are not to be picked or chosen.. If a place can be come
      by, it will be because some person who thought to attend cannot be
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that where there are so many faces a chance recognition is
      possible? I should be but an atom in the multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless his seeing you is most unlikely. I shall do my best for you,
      and hope to obtain an entrance for to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that Frances was one of the fashionable audience next
      day, occupying the place of a lady who had attended the trial from the
      first, but was now tired of it, seeking some new excitement, thus missing
      the most dramatic scene of that notable tragedy. Frances found herself one
      of a bevy of gaily dressed ladies, all of whom were gossiping and
      chattering together, comparing notes they had taken of the proceedings,
      for many of them had dainty writing-books in which they set down the
      points that pleased them as the case went on. It seemed like a gala day,
      animated by a thrill of eager expectancy; a social function, entirely
      pleasurable, with no hint that a man stood in jeopardy of his life.
      Although the body of the hall was crowded, draped benches at the upper end
      were still untenanted, except that here and there sat a man, serving
      rather to emphasize the emptiness of the benches than give token of
      occupancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady placed at Frances&rsquo;s right, observing that the girl was a stranger
      and somewhat bewildered by the unaccustomed scene, kindly made explanation
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On those benches will sit the Lords, who are the judges; on the others
      the Commons, who are the accusers. They have not yet taken their
      stations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the King be present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Technically, no; actually, yes. The Throne, which you see there, will be
      vacant throughout, but the King may be behind that latticed screen above
      it, where he can see but cannot be seen. The King must not interfere at a
      State trial, but he may overset its verdict, and he will, if it should go
      against the Earl, which is not likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I do not see my&mdash;&mdash;I do not see the Earl of Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not here yet, and will not arrive until the Houses sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl listened to the hum of conversation going on round her, and
      caught understandable scraps of it now and then. She was in an entirely
      new atmosphere, for here every one seemed in favour of Strafford, thought
      him badly used, and was certain he would emerge triumphant from the
      ordeal. <i>Then</i> let his enemies beware! Feminine opinion was unanimous
      that all those who were concerned in this trial against his lordship would
      bitterly regret the day they had taken such action. The spirits of Frances
      rose as she listened. The invariable confidence by which she was environed
      had its inspiring effect on her depressed mind. She no longer thought the
      gathering heartlessly frivolous, as at first she had resentfully estimated
      it. She was in the midst of enthusiastic champions of her father, and
      realized now, as never before, the great part he played in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a movement in the upper part of the Hall, and Lords and
      Commons filed in to their places. A silence fell on the audience,
      maintained also in dignified state by the judges, but to the section
      occupied by the Commons was transferred the rustle of talk which had
      previously disturbed the stillness of the auditorium. Men bustled about,
      whispering to this member of Parliament or that. Papers and notes were
      exchanged, while by contrast their Lordships seemed like inanimate
      statues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again the centre of attention changed. The Hall resounded with the
      measured tramp of armed men. Two rows of soldiers took their stand
      opposite each other, leaving a clear passage between, and slowly up this
      passage, with four secretaries and some halfdozen others behind him, came
      a bowed and pallid figure, dressed in black, a single decoration relieving
      the sombreness of his costume, which hung, loosely unfitting, about a
      frame that had become gaunt since its wear began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the Earl of Strafford,&rdquo; whispered the lady on the right, but the
      remark fell upon unlistening ears. How changed he was! No trace now of
      that arrogance of which she had caught chance glimpses during her brief
      acquaintance with him; a broken man who had but a short time to live,
      whatever might be the verdict of this court. Sentence of death was already
      passed on him by a higher tribunal, and all this convocation might do was
      to forestall its execution. He stood in his place for a moment, and bowed
      to his judges, but gave no sign that he had knowledge of the existence of
      his accusers, and the girl began to doubt if the old arrogance had, after
      all, entirely departed from him. Then, leaning heavily on the arm of one
      of his secretaries, he sank into his seat and closed his eyes, as if the
      short walk from the barge to the hall of judgment had been too much for
      him. As he sat thus there stole down to him a boy leading two children.
      Strafford&rsquo;s eyes opened, and he smiled wanly upon them, put an arm around
      the hoy&rsquo;s neck, and fondled the girls to his knee, both of whom were
      weeping quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who are those?&rdquo; gasped Frances, yet knowing while she asked,
      and feeling a pang, half jealousy, half pain, that she must hold aloof
      unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are his son and his two daughters. The third daughter is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The third!&rdquo; she&rsquo; cried in surprise. &ldquo;Does he then acknowledge a third?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The third is an infant too young to know what is going on. Hush! We must
      not talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eagerness fell away from her; she reclined back in her seat and
      sighed deeply. The preliminaries of the day passed her like a dream, for
      she knew nothing of the procedure, but at last her attention was aroused,
      for she saw her father on his feet, and before she was aware he began to
      speak, the voice at first cold and calm, penetrating the remotest corner
      of that vast room, in argument that even she recognized as clear, logical,
      and dispassioned as if he were setting forth the case of another. He was
      listened to with the most profound respect by enemies and friends alike.
      He seemed to brush away the charges against him as if they were very
      cobwebs of accusation. As he went on, he warmed more to his theme, and by
      and by the girl, leaning intently forward, drinking in every word, knew
      that she was listening to oratory such as had never before greeted the
      ears of England, and probably never would again. A breathless tension held
      the audience spellbound, and it seemed impossible that his direst foe
      could remain unmoved. The belief in his acquittal now became a certainty,
      and it was every moment more and more evident that this acquittal would
      also be a triumph. He stood, one man against three kingdoms thirsting for
      the blood, yet turning the crisis to the dumfounding of his enemies by the
      overwhelming force of eloquence. Not a chord on the harp of human
      sentiment and passion was left unsounded. The deft hand swept every string
      and fascinated his hearers. When he spoke of his children, pleading more
      for them than for himself, they weeping at his knee, his own voice broke
      into a sob more touching even than his living words. From the eyes of
      Frances gushed the pent-up tears. And she was not alone in her emotion,
      for the flutter of lace at the eyes of fair ladies broke like white
      blossoms everywhere. And yet&mdash;&mdash;and yet she became reluctantly
      convinced that her father in this crisis had entirely forgotten her, and
      when he spoke of his children, remembered only those that had been all
      their lives about his knees. She was but the daughter of a day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering himself, the speaker went on to his peroration. &ldquo;And now, my
      lords, I thank God, I have been, by His blessing, sufficiently instructed
      in the extreme vanity of all temporal enjoyments, compared to the
      importance of our eternal duration. And so, my lords, even so, with all
      humility and with all tranquillity of mind, I submit clearly and freely to
      your judgments. And whether that righteous doom shall be to life or death,
      I shall repose myself, full of gratitude and confidence, in the arms of
      the Great Author of my existence. <i>Te Deum laudamus, te Dominum
      confitemur</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Latin phrase pealed forth like the solemn tone of a chant, and the
      speaker subsided into his chair almost in a swoon, for physical weakness
      had at last overcome the indomitable spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On none of the vast visible throng had the effective oration exercised
      greater power than upon an unseen listener. The awed stillness was
      suddenly broken by a splintering crash, and the startled audience, looking
      up, saw the frail lattice work of the alcove shattered, and the King
      standing there like a ghost enframed by jagged laths. Stern determination
      sat on that handsome countenance; a look which said as plainly as words, &ldquo;<i>This
      man shall not die!</i>&rdquo; His hands clutched the broken framework beneath
      him, and he moistened his lips as if to give utterance to the words his
      expression foreshadowed. But before he could speak, a tall, angular figure
      sprang out from among the Commons and held up a sinewy hand. His face was
      ablaze with anger; his stentorian voice dominated the Hall, envenomed with
      hatred, striking the ear with terror as does the roar of a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The might of England, in Parliament assembled, gives judgment untrammeled
      and unafraid. The King is not here. The King cannot be here. The Throne is
      vacant, and must remain vacant until justice is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the last words rang out, the long index finger, shaken menacingly,
      pointed at the empty chair. There was defiance of King or Minister in
      words, and tone and gesture; a challenge to the Throne. The pale face of
      the King became ghastly white, his hand trembled, and fragments of the
      lattice-work fell from beneath it. Irresolution took the place of former
      determination, and he glanced pitifully from right to left, as if seeking
      human support, of which, in the amazed stillness, there was no indication.
      Then the fine white hand of an unseen woman showed for a moment on his arm
      like a snow-flake, and Charles, with one look of haunting compassion on
      the prisoner, disappeared from sight. The phantom picture had vanished
      from its ragged frame without a sound, and blank darkness occupied its
      place. Truly the King was not present, conjured away by the strenuous hand
      of the fierce combatant on the stage, and the soft hand of the woman
      behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; whispered Frances, gazing in frightened fascination on
      the rude interrupter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is John Pym, the chief prosecutor and deadly personal enemy of Lord
      Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the girl gazed at this dominating individuality, all the froth of
      confidence in her father&rsquo;s acquittal, whipped up by the chatter of
      conversation at the beginning, evaporated. There stood the personified
      hatred of England against the Earl of Strafford. No wavering in accent or
      action there, but a determined man, knowing what he wanted and bent on
      having it. To her excited imagination the resolute face took on the
      semblance of a death-mask, and the clenched hand seemed to grasp the shaft
      of an axe. It was as if the headsman had suddenly stood forth and claimed
      his own, and a chill as of the grave, swept over the audience with a
      shudder in its wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low wailing cry went sobbing across the silence; a cry that tugged at
      Strafford&rsquo;s heart when he heard it. What memory did it stir in his
      troubled mind? A reminiscence of something that had escaped him, crowded
      out by matters of more pressing moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing, my lord,&rdquo; answered Vollins, stepping between his master
      and the commotion among the women. &ldquo;A lady has fainted, that is all. They
      are taking her out.&rdquo;

      open air, Frances Wentworth came again into control of herself, ashamed
      that, for the moment, her emotions had overwhelmed her. She had no desire
      to re-enter Westminster Hall, even if the doorkeepers would have permitted
      her, so she wandered slowly back to the inn which was her temporary home.
      In the evening John Vollins came to see her, and offered money which she
      told him she did not need. He gave some account of Pym&rsquo;s speech, and said
      that the Commons had not asked the Lords for judgment, which was taken by
      Strafford and his friends as an indication that they knew the weakness of
      the evidence and feared the effect of his lordship&rsquo;s speech in his own
      defence. The refusal to ask for judgment was regarded as a good omen, and
      for some days Frances felt the revival of hope, when she could forget the
      grim figure of John Pym, but the Commons speedily disillusioned the
      Straffordian party. A bill of attainder was brought in, and they showed
      their determination to have the head of the unfortunate Earl by act of
      Parliament, if not by legal procedure. At last the bill, passing its third
      reading, was sent up to the House of Lords. There were many who said the
      Lords would never assent to it; that the Commons should have asked for
      judgment at the close of the trial; that if they could not hope to have
      the verdict as they wanted it then, it was not likely the Lords would
      allow themselves to be cozened by a side wind now. These predictions were
      quickly falsified. The Lords gave their consent to the bill of attainder,
      and nothing stood between Strafford and the block but a scrawl from the
      King&rsquo;s pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lords, it was said by those who defended them, had been coerced by the
      populace. The mob had gathered again and had clamoured around the House of
      Peers, crying for justice on Strafford; now they transferred their
      loud-throated exclamations to Whitehall, for success with the nobles
      foreshadowed success with the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late on Saturday night when John Vollins made his way to the inn at
      some jeopardy to himself, for the streets were wild with joy at the action
      of the Lords. He told Frances that her father&rsquo;s life depended solely on
      the firmness of the King. If Charles signed on Monday, Strafford was to be
      led to the block on Wednesday. Vollins was in deep gloom over the
      prospect. The Earl, he said, had some time previously written to the King,
      absolving him from all his promises, offering his life freely if the
      taking of it would advantage his Majesty in dealing with his obstreperous
      subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the King is trebly perjured if he signs. He cannot sign,&rdquo; cried
      Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vollins shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all the Lords in England are held in terror by the people&rsquo;s clamour,
      and so let the greatest of their number slip through their fingers to the
      axe, how can one weak man be expected to withstand the concentration of
      the popular will brought against him? &rsquo;T is blinded folly to look
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the people dare not coerce a King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare they not? Go down to Whitehall and you will find them doing it. This
      very day they have all but stormed the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see the King, throw myself at his feet and implore him to keep his
      word. I was present when he bade my father take this fateful journey to
      London, and when he promised full protection. A King&rsquo;s word should stand
      against the world, for he is the source of truth and honour in a nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot get to see him. Every entrance to the palace is strongly
      guarded. Highly placed friends of my lord, friends when all others had
      fallen away from him, have sought admission to the royal presence in vain.
      He has refused to see the Earl of Bristol, whose son, Lord Digby, spoke
      out against the conclusiveness of the evidence, and his Majesty has let it
      be spread abroad that he gives no approval of Lord Digby&rsquo;s plain words,
      and so the people cry &lsquo;God save the King!&rsquo; and revile Lord Digby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood aghast at this intelligence, remembering the scene at the
      trial, when royalty in the person of Charles Stuart, and the people in the
      person of John Pym, opposed their wills to each other. Then royalty had
      faded from the sight of men, and the strong champion of the people held
      his ground alone and triumphant. &ldquo;Trust in God and the King,&rdquo; wrote the
      prisoner. What a conjunction! Almighty power, and a bending reed!
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I will see the King,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday the immensity of the swaying crowd, shouting and moving like a
      slow resistless flood through the streets, daunted her. There was no
      employment that day to keep any one within doors, and it seemed as if that
      labyrinth of human warrens called London had emptied itself into the
      narrow thoroughfares. She hesitated like a timid swimmer on the brink of a
      raging torrent, yet if she was to win access to the King she must trust
      herself to the current, which had this advantage, it set toward the
      direction in which she wished to go. If the streets could be compared to
      sluggish streams, the broad avenue or square of Whitehall might be likened
      to the lake into which they emptied. It was a packed mass of humanity,
      surging to and fro, as if influenced by mysterious tides, but making no
      progress. Way through it in any given direction might well seem an
      impossibility; but an alert atom, by constantly watching opportunity,
      could edge here and there, through chance openings, and, by a constant
      devotion to a given direction, ultimately attain any chosen point. Thus
      the girl, buffeted about, often well-nigh exhausted and breathless, came
      by the entrance to the palace that stood next the banqueting-house. The
      gates, however, were tightly closed, and guarded on the outside by a
      double row of soldiery, who stood the hustling of the mob with great good
      humour, being evidently cautioned not to exasperate the populace by any
      hostile act. The crowd itself seemed good-natured enough, although
      constant fighting took place here and there along its choking surface; but
      the great bulk of those present appeared to be out on a larking holiday,
      although they all riotously lent breath to the unceasing roar, calling for
      justice on Strafford. Occasionally there were shouts for the King, and
      demands that he should speak to them, but the windows of Whitehall Palace
      were blank and gave no sign of human occupancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Frances found herself in new danger through one of those
      unexplainable heaves of the many-throated beast at whose mercy she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the gates!&rdquo; went up a shout. &ldquo;We will make the King hear,&rdquo; and a great
      human wave, overwhelming the soldiers, struck against the shuddering
      portal. The mere pressure of the multitude was deadly and irresistible.
      There were shrieks and appeals for forbearance, but the unreasoning mass
      behind pressed on, unheeding, cheering, and shoving. A crash of rending
      timbers, and the gates flew inward; then the mob, as if frightened at what
      it had done, paused, giving the soldiers time to collect themselves and
      help the wounded. There was as yet no malice in the crush; it was more
      like a conglomeration of irresponsible children, bent on mischief of any
      kind, but temporarily scared at the breaking of something. This fact
      seemed to be recognized by a man in authority who came through the gate
      and with some difficulty secured a precarious footing on one of the stone
      pillars which stood in a row between the pathway and the road, thus giving
      him a position which towered over the heads of the assemblage. He held up
      a hand for a hearing, and the crowd cheered him, not in the least knowing
      who he was or why he was there. Comparative silence followed the cheer,
      and the nobleman spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is little use in the breaking of gates
      that the King may hear you; for the King has heard, and is taking the
      requests of his faithful subjects into his august consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the King?&rdquo; demanded an auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty is in the banqueting-house, where, as you know, he is in
      touch with his people. &rsquo;T is a prayerful subject he has to meditate
      on, and I beg of you not to disturb his devotions by further&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Queen at her devotions too? In that hall she began masked revels
      on a Sunday, and six good men were done to death for protesting against
      the desecration, each life more valuable than the wicked Earl&rsquo;s. Let the
      King say that he will sign, and we will disperse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These and other cries more or less to the purpose baffled the orator, and
      the air quivered with denunciations of Strafford. The man on the stone
      post had cast his eyes behind him several times, as if to see what
      progress was being made with the readjustment of the gate, and from this
      his hearers quickly divined that he was but deluding them to gain time,
      which was more than likely his purpose, so the shout went up to move
      through the breach and surround the hall. Meanwhile reinforcements had
      been summoned from within, and a hand-to-hand fight ensued with the
      encroachers. Frances, panting and nigh worn out in the struggle,
      nevertheless saw her opportunity. There were few women in the throng, and
      such as came near them the soldiers sought to protect. She attempted
      appeal to the officer, but that harassed dignitary could harken to none,
      and thrust her rudely but effectually through the opening, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      will find egress at one of the other gates. Take care of yourself. I
      cannot help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breathing a sigh of thankfulness, she cowered and ran along the end of the
      banqueting-hall, turned at the corner, then down the side, entering an
      archway that let her into a passage. She knew that she must turn to her
      right, but where after that she had not the slightest notion. The tumult
      at the gate was so frightful that she expected every moment to hear the
      victorious assaulters at her heels. Her joy at finding herself thus
      unexpectedly within the precincts of the palace, unimpeded, caused her to
      overlook the fact that this was scarcely a propitious moment in which to
      implore the King to disregard the lusty giant rudely beating at his doors.
      A frightened waiting-maid came hurrying along the corridor, and to her she
      directed inquiry regarding the entrance to the banqueting-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to the right and up the stair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me there, I beg of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot. I bear a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I bear a message to the King, so yours must wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the maid turned and conducted her to the door of the hall, saying
      to the man at arms,&mdash;&ldquo;This lady has a message for his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that struck her on entering the great painted chamber was
      that the nobleman on the stone outside had not spoken the truth when he
      said the King heard the demands of his people. A growl as of an angry lion
      penetrated the closed windows, but the words spoken were not to be
      distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was sitting at a massive table, his head in his hands. Behind him
      were grouped a number of bishops in their robes, and it certainly seemed
      that his Majesty was engaged in devotional exercises, as had been stated
      by the orator. But if this were the case they were of a strangely mixed
      order, for behind the lady who was talking volubly to the King, stood two
      Capuchin monks with folded arms. Excepting the bishops none of the English
      nobility were present, but several Frenchmen, among whom she recognized De
      Courcy, held aloof from the cluster at the table, so the girl quite
      correctly surmised that the lady bearing the whole burden of the
      conversation was no other than the Queen herself, and that these
      foreigners were members of her train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Majesty spoke sometimes in French, sometimes in English, the latter
      with broken accent, and her eloquence was rather puzzling to follow, for
      the flow of her conversation was of extreme rapidity. Palpably she
      supposed herself talking in English, but whenever she came to a difficulty
      in the choice of a word she made no attempt to surmount it by any effort
      of thought, but swam swiftly round it on the easy current of her native
      tongue. Translated, her discourse ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! These good men have made it perfectly plain; for, as they say,&mdash;and
      who shall question the dictum of the Church in such matters,&mdash;you
      have two consciences, the conscience of the Prince and the conscience&rsquo; of
      the man; and where the consciences come into conflict that of the Prince
      must of necessity rule, as is the axiom in all civilized Courts. Is it
      right that you, a King, should jeopardize yourself in a useless effort to
      save one condemned by his peers, because your private conscience as a man
      urges you to keep a promise which he himself has relieved you from,
      holding you guiltless before God and the nations, and further advised by
      these good men, lords of their Church, that such action would not make
      toward peace of the realm. It is not a subject to be hesitated upon for a
      moment, the good of the ruler being paramount always&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my lord, the King, listen not to such sophistry, be it from the lips
      of priest or woman. The given word is the man, and he stands or falls by
      it. If the foresworn peasant be a cringing craven, ten thousand times
      worse is the perjured Prince. You pledged your faith to Lord Strafford,
      and now, in his just Heaven, God demands the fulfilment of your word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dishevelled girl had flung herself at the feet of the frightened
      monarch, who started back, gazing wildly about him, shaking as one struck
      with palsy, so startling and unexpected had been the interruption. Red
      anger flushed the face of the no less amazed Queen, speechless with
      indignation at the words and the tone of them, addressed to her exalted
      husband. The sage bishops were astounded at the lack of diplomacy on the
      part of the petitioner, who had thus rudely thrown herself counter to the
      expressed wishes of the highest lady in the land; but Frances, with an
      instant intuition more subtle than theirs, saw that the Queen was an enemy
      not to be cajoled by deference or flattery, so she determined that the war
      between them should be open and above board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had reason for agitation greater than the surprise that had made
      breathing statues of those about him. The accents that disturbed him were
      the accents of Strafford himself, softened as they were by the lips that
      uttered them. The boldness of the address was Strafford&rsquo;s, and, until he
      saw that a woman knelt before him, it almost seemed that the dominant
      spirit of the prisoner had burst the bonds of the Tower and sped hither to
      reproach him for meditated treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances, gathering breath, took advantage of the silence her sudden advent
      had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is Lord Strafford in a dungeon to-day? Because, trusting your word,
      he obeyed your command at Hampton. Why was he put on trial? Because,
      faithfully, he carried out his King&rsquo;s behests. Why was he condemned to
      death? Because he stood true to the King. If he deserve death, then so do
      you, for you are the master and he the servant. Has God stricken you and
      your counsellors with blindness, that you cannot see in the destruction of
      Strafford the throwing away of the shield which guards your breast,
      leaving you naked to your enemies? Surrender bastion, and the castle
      falls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God of Heaven!&rdquo; cried the quivering Queen. &ldquo;What country of the mad is
      this, where the meanest of subjects may so address a monarch! Strip the
      mantle from her back and scourge her rebellious flesh to the kennel whence
      she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; gasped Charles, staggering to his feet and sweeping with a
      gesture of his hand the documents which lay before him on the table, so
      that they fluttered to the floor. &ldquo;Christ have mercy upon me! She speaks
      the truth; happy is the Prince who hears it and heeds it. I have passed my
      word to Strafford, and it shall be kept. I will not sign,&mdash;no, though
      the heavens fall. Rise, my girl! You have my promise,&mdash;the promise of
      a Stuart,&mdash;and it shall be fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles graciously assisted the girl to her feet with the same courtesy he
      would have shown to the first lady of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rage of the Queen now passed all bounds of restraint. &ldquo;And this before
      me, your wife! You weigh the word of this bedraggled creature of the
      streets above that of the royal House of France, and Queen of this
      turbulent realm! By God, you deserve to be hooted by your loathsome mob.
      Who is this strumpet?&rdquo; De Courcy whispered a word into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! The bastard of that profligate Strafford! Jesu, to what a pass this
      Christian Court has come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Frances with frigid dignity, &ldquo;you misname me. I have the
      honour to be Lord Strafford&rsquo;s lawful daughter, acknowledged by him as such
      in presence of his Majesty the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is true, &rsquo;t is true,&rdquo; murmured Charles, visibly quailing
      before the increasing wrath of his wife, adding in piteous appeal, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
      wounds, have I not enough to bear without the quarreling of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The quarreling of women! Dare you couple me in the same breath with such
      as she? Is there none in my train to whip forth this impudent wench into
      the wretched rabble that has spewed her into our presence. The quarreling
      of women! A slattern that wishes to divert, from her reputed father&rsquo;s head
      to yours, the anger of the gutter. Listen to it, my lord, listen to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was shrieked forth with gestures so rapid and amazing that the
      eye could scarce follow the motion of her hands. Now she flew to the
      window and fumbled with its fastening, too greatly excited to succeed with
      the opening. Several of the French gallants stumbled over each other in
      their haste to aid her, but the lady&rsquo;s impatience could not wait for them.
      She lifted her clenched hand and smote the diamond panes, which went
      shivering down beneath the fierce impact of the blow. Glass or lead or
      both cut the imperious hand and wrist, and the blood trickled down the
      fair rounded arm. The breach she made was like the letting in of waters;
      the roar outside became instantly articulate, and waves of meaning flooded
      the great apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the block with Strafford. Death to the people&rsquo;s oppressor!&rdquo; was the
      cry, and the tortured King shrank from it as from the lash of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harken to the wolves!&rdquo; shrieked the Queen. &ldquo;It is your blood or
      Strafford&rsquo;s! Which, which, which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, perhaps because of the hurt which she scarcely seemed to feel, her
      mood changed as quickly as her anger had risen, and she melted into tears,
      glided to her husband, and threw her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Charles, Charles,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;it is my love for you that would
      coerce you. You have not been to blame, misled by an obstinate Minister
      who would sacrifice an indulgent master to buy his own safety. A King is
      not to be bound as other men. The claim of your wife and children rise
      superior to that of any subject, for you have sworn to protect them.&rdquo;
       Charles stood by the wall which was eight years later to be broken for his
      own final exit, his eyes filled with tears, caressing the woman who clung
      to his breast. He saw that the girl was about to address him again and
      said hastily,&mdash;&ldquo;Go, go! You but pile distraction on distraction. Fear
      not; for the word of a King goes with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; sobbed the Queen. &ldquo;For my sake withdraw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the bishops now stepped forward, and with gentle urgency used their
      persuasion on the girl to withdraw. &ldquo;God keep your Majesty firm,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;and so deal with you as you deal with my father.&rdquo; But the last
      sight she was to have of her ruler, as the good men pushed her to the
      door, was far from inspiring. His cheeks were womanishly wet, and wavering
      irresolution was stamped upon his brow. The twining wounded arms of his
      wife had reddened the white scarf at his throat with the royal, passionate
      blood of France.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;EXECUTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n Monday there
      were ever-increasing rumours through the town that Charles had signed the
      bill which would send his chief Minister to the block, qualified by
      statements equally vague that he had done nothing of the sort; but as
      night drew on, the rising jubilation of the crowds in the streets gave
      point to the more sinister report. In the evening, his usual time of
      calling, the sombre Vollins came to the inn, chiefly, as he said, to urge
      the girl to quit the turbulent city, where she could accomplish nothing,
      and where she might be in danger were it once guessed that she bore any
      relationship to the condemned man; but to this good counsel the girl would
      not listen. What she demanded impatiently was news, news, news, and this,
      with exasperating deliberation, Vollins gave forth. It was quite true that
      the bill was signed, not by the King&rsquo;s hand, but by the hands of four
      Commissioners whom he had appointed for that purpose. The House of Lords,
      and even the House of Commons, was amazed at this betrayal, said Vollins,
      and the effect of the announcement had been seen on the populace itself;
      for, after certainty came home to the people, they had dispersed quietly
      to their houses, and the streets were almost empty.

      The girl was mute with dismay, but Vollins pointed out that the case was
      in reality no worse than it had been on Saturday or Sunday. By the
      exercise of his prerogative the King could at any moment free his Minister
      or mitigate the sentence, notwithstanding the fact that the Commission had
      signed the bill of attainder in his name. Vollins had always been
      distrustful of the King, but his pessimism was not increased by the
      hurrying events of the last few days; rather, he saw signs of
      encouragement where Frances found only blank despair. The signing had had
      the immediate effect of stilling the outcry of the public, yet it in no
      way increased Strafford&rsquo;s danger. The action was merely typical of the
      King&rsquo;s roundabout methods of accomplishing his objects. The people were
      notoriously fickle and could not keep up the shouting indefinitely; indeed
      there were already signs that they were tired of it. It was more than
      likely that Charles would reprieve the Earl, possibly at the last moment,
      and have him shipped off to France or Holland before London knew what had
      been done. Or, it might be, Strafford would escape when Charles saw that
      Lords, Commons, and people were in grim earnest. The Tower was on the
      waterside, and the prisoner would not be the first who had slipped away by
      boat the night before an intended execution. Such a plan would be
      peculiarly acceptable to the mind of the King, for he had given way to the
      expressed will of his subjects and could not be held responsible for the
      avolation of the convicted man. The Tower was impregnable and cared
      nothing for clamour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday seemed to bear out these surmises. Frances determined to see the
      King once more, and learn from his own lips the fate of her father; but
      when she reached Whitehall she found some commotion there, for Charles was
      taking his departure from the palace, and people said he was on his way to
      the House of Lords, and that it was likely he had determined to let
      Strafford go. Even although this suspicion was prevalent among those
      assembled, there seemed to be no popular resentment of it, and the crowd
      loudly cheered Charles as he rode away surrounded by his jingling guards&mdash;truly
      a remarkable change in public sentiment since Sunday. She went from
      Whitehall to the Tower, viewing the stronghold from various points, but
      not venturing near it. At first she had some thought of asking admission
      that she might see her father; but she was almost certain a refusal was
      all she might expect, and there was ever the fear she would arouse inquiry
      by making any application, and so frustrate plans already formed for his
      rescue. Vague visions passed through her mind of prisoners escaping
      through the devotion of friends sacrificing themselves, or concocting
      ingenious schemes that resulted in liberty; but as she looked at the
      forbidding, strong fortress, her dreams were confronted by a very stern
      reality, and the conviction was impressed upon her that there was nothing
      to be gained in lingering about the Tower. After all, the word of the King
      was sufficient to open the gates, could he but pluck up courage to speak
      it. He was bound in honour to say the word, and Frances saw that her only
      chance of helpfulness lay in urging him to keep his promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening she learned authoritatively the object of the King&rsquo;s visit
      to the House of Lords. He had pleaded earnestly for the life of his
      Minister, promising, if he were released, never again to employ him even
      in the meanest capacity. He implored them at least to grant a reprieve
      until Saturday, and this was so small a favour for a King to ask that
      Vollins was sure it would be granted, and that many things might happen in
      the intervening days. The confidence of a man so generally despairing as
      Vollins, in the certainty of a short reprieve, and in the ultimate safety
      of Lord Stratford, did much to bring the girl to a like belief, but she
      resolved, nevertheless, to see the King next day if she could win her way
      into Whitehall Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday saw no excitement on the streets; people were going soberly
      about, each on his own affairs, and the reprieve had provoked no outburst,
      which in itself was a hopeful sign. Frances had grown to fear the hue and
      cry of the mob even more than she feared the indecision of the King. If he
      were left unterrified, all his tendency was toward mercy and the keeping
      of his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no crowd to distract the attention of the guard at the palace
      gates opening on Whitehall, and they absolutely refused to grant her
      admission without an order. She turned to the captain of the guard and
      asked how such an order could be obtained, and that official, apparently
      struck by her youth and beauty, as well as her evident distress, said that
      if she knew any about the Court who might be sent for, and who proved
      willing to vouch for her, he would allow her to pass; but the rule at the
      gate was strict, because of past disturbances, and he had no option but
      refusal unless she went in under the convoy of some one in authority.
      Frances pondered a few moments, and hesitated, but her need was great, and
      she could not choose when it came to finding security. At last she said
      with reluctance,&mdash;&ldquo;I am acquainted with Monsieur De Courcy. Is he
      within?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, but &rsquo;t will be speedily ascertained.&rdquo; With that he
      invited her to a seat in the guardhouse, and sent a messenger for De
      Courcy, knowing there would be prompt response when the Frenchman learned
      that a beautiful lady awaited him, and in this he was not mistaken. De
      Courcy came, as debonair and as well groomed as usual, twirling his light
      moustache, and doffing his hat with a grand air when he saw who his
      petitioner was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see his Majesty again,&rdquo; said Frances, rising; &ldquo;but they detain
      me at the gate, and I have no one to vouch for me unless you will be so
      kind, though I am sorry to trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pleasure me, Mademoiselle, you must mean. &rsquo;T is an ungallant
      country, as I have always said, when they keep so fair a maid a-waiting.
      Such a boorish act is not conceivable in France. Most honoured am I to be
      your sponsor, and it gratifies me to tell you that the King is at present
      disengaged. I beg you to accompany me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friend of the Queen did not even trouble to make any explanation to
      the captain of the guard, and he was too powerful a courtier to have
      anything he did questioned by the underlings. It was palpable that the
      officer had small liking for him, but wholesome fear of his influence in
      high places.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two crossed the yard together, the young man said with the greatest
      affability,&mdash;&ldquo;Would you prefer to see the King alone, or in company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, alone, if it be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possible. I shall delight in arranging a private interview, and am
      sure his Majesty will not refuse my request. If you do not wish to meet
      any of the Court, I can take you to him by a private route where we are
      almost certain to encounter none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be deeply indebted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They threaded their way through devious and labyrinthian passages, turning
      now to the right, now to the left, sometimes ascending a few steps, and
      sometimes a narrow stairway, until at last the guide came to a door which
      he pushed open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will wait here for a moment, I will go and fetch the King.&rdquo; He
      bowed gracefully as she passed through the doorway, entering a square
      room, the walls of which were decorated by groups of swords and rapiers of
      various sorts; a veritable armory. A table occupied the centre, and there
      were several chairs, with a lounge against the wall. A door opened upon an
      inner room. De Courcy, instead of taking his departure, stepped in quickly
      after the girl, closed the door, and turned the key in the lock. With the
      grating of the key came the first suspicion to the mind of Frances that
      her guide was treacherous. Much as she had always distrusted him, it
      seemed incredible that, knowing her to be the daughter of the Earl of
      Strafford, anything disastrous might befall her here in the very palace of
      the King, the sworn protector of his people. The leer on De Courcy&rsquo;s face
      and his words speedily disillusioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be seated, my dear, we may have some converse, interesting
      and entertaining to us both. You can scarcely imagine my joy at seeing so
      lovely a visitor in my poor apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you said you would bring the King. A gentleman keeps his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the King in good time, my pretty one. Charles is but a doleful
      companion just now, and we are well quit of him. As for a man&rsquo;s word, the
      fashion seems to be the breaking of it, example being set us poor
      gentlemen in the highest places. For instance, our last discussion related
      to marriage, but times have changed since that day, and you will not be so
      cruel as to expect me to carry out the good domestic intentions I then
      expressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am very glad I shall hear no more of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly? Then so much the better. I expected tears and reproaches, but am
      pleased you are not given to complaining. By my honour, I love you the
      more for it. So, then, I&rsquo;ll steal a kiss from those ripe lips to seal the
      new compact we are to make, and I warn you that a scream is not likely to
      be heard from this chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not your warning. You shall neither hear me scream nor see me
      weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Denis, I like your spirit. Some scream, and some weep, but they
      all end by clinging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, a warning for your warning. Approach not another step nearer me.
      Stand aside, rather, and allow me quittance of this place as freely as I
      ignorantly came hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I cannot consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then &rsquo;t will be the worse for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth, but you spur an inclination already highly mettled. Still
      would I treat you with all courtesy. You are a nameless woman, and many of
      the highest dames in England are proud to call me their friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I believe to be as untrue as your saying I am a nameless woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, one is as true as the other. Your father never acknowledged
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been burdened with more important affairs, but he will do so when
      he is free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this dialogue the participants had been constantly changing their
      positions, De Courcy advancing and Frances retreating, keeping the table
      between them. The girl&rsquo;s design was plain enough; she desired to hold him
      in conversation, gradually shifting her position, until she got between
      him and the door, when a sudden dash might give her freedom. But he easily
      fathomed this design and laughed as he checkmated it. At her last words,
      however, he drew himself upright, a look of genuine amazement
      overspreading his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is <i>free!</i>&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Powers of Heaven! Then you have not
      come to reproach the King, but to plead with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I reproach him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would surely be useless enough, but feminine. Why? Because Gregory
      Brandon, with one good stroke, severed the King&rsquo;s word and Strafford&rsquo;s
      neck on Tower Hill this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s face went white as the kerchief about her throat, and, swaying
      half an instant, she leaned against the table for support. Something in
      the brutal method of the announcement convinced her of its truth more
      surely than if he had spoken with all the solemnity of which he might be
      capable. Yet she struggled not to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lying to me,&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it, my little lady. How could I imagine you did not know? You
      are surely the only person in London who is ignorant of it. Why is
      everything so quiet near Whitehall, where the generous citizens have been
      so solicitous about us of late? Merely because the centre of interest has
      changed to the other end of the town, and a rare show was put on the stage
      for all good people to see, free of cost to themselves, unless they have
      the brains to know of what they are bereft by Strafford&rsquo;s death, which is
      most unlikely.&rdquo; As he spoke he had been edging toward her, catlike, but
      she paid no heed to him. Then with a spring he caught her wrists, but she
      did not move or make any effort to free herself. She looked dully at him,
      as if wondering why he acted so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be pleased to withdraw yourself, sir, and let me go. My heart is
      broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with forced calmness, but there was a tremor in her tone that
      cast doubt on her former assertion regarding the tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your heart is not broken, and if it was I&rsquo;d mend it for you. Absurd! Why,
      you knew the man for scarce a day, and that time is full short for the
      growth of any large affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never love any as I have loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush! How little you know of yourself. You are a very goddess of love,
      and I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released one wrist and endeavored to slip his disengaged arm about her
      waist. This seemed to rouse the girl from her stupor, for she suddenly
      thrust him back, and, taking him unaware, sent him sprawling; then she
      sprang for the door. But he was as nimble as she, for, quickly recovering
      himself, he held her tight before she could turn the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you forget who I am. Release me at once, and molest me no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divinest of the fair, I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whisked herself free of him, and, darting to the other side of the
      room, whipped down a thin rapier from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be well advised to put an end to this fooling. I am now in no
      humour for it, and with you, never. If you have not the gift to see it, I
      would have you know that I detest you and despise you, and have done so
      since first I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my little lady Termagant, you say as much now; but when the world
      knows you paid a thousand pounds for a lover there will be many envious
      persons who wish to be despised as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ruffian and thief! Well did Vollins estimate your honesty. But stand
      aside from that door, or your stealing will profit you little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried De Courcy with a laugh, as he possessed himself of a
      similar weapon to that which threatened him. &ldquo;&rsquo;T is already
      squandered, and I am in sore need of a further instalment. Are you for a
      duel, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are coward enough to lift blade to a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meet kiss with kiss, and steel with steel; always ready for either.
      Guard yourself, Madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pretended antagonism was but a feint to throw her off the guard he
      advised her to maintain, for, being one of the best swordsmen of his time,
      he knew by her holding of the blade that she was ignorant of its practice.
      He brushed her sword aside, dropped his own, and sprang in upon her,
      grasping again her helpless wrists, her arms pinioned thus transversely
      across her body, her right hand still clinging to the useless hilt, with
      the blade extending past her shoulder and behind her. His sneering,
      grinning face so close to hers that his breath fanned her cheek, he
      pressed her back and back against the wall, the sword bending and bending
      behind her until the blade snapped off some six inches from the hilt and
      fell ringing to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sweetest of Amazons, you are stingless now, and naught but the
      honey is to be gathered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very ease with which he had overcome her hoodwinked him to his danger.
      The proud dominant blood of the Wentworths flushed her face with an anger
      that steeled every nerve in her lithe body. As, with a victorious laugh,
      he released her wrists and slipped his arms around her, she struck him
      twice with lightning swiftness, first across the brow, then down the face.
      Nothing could well be more terrible than the weapon she had used, for the
      jagged iron tore his flesh like the stroke of a tiger&rsquo;s claw. The red
      cross showed for a brief moment, then was obliterated in a crimson flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowardly poltroon, wear the brand of Cain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had warned her not to scream, but now his own cries filled the room as
      he staggered back, his hands to his face. Yet, grievously wounded as he
      was, he seemed resolved she should not escape him, and, after the first
      shock, groped blindly for her. She flung the broken weapon to the further
      side of the room, and the noise of its fall turned him thither, striking
      against the table, and then against a chair. She tip-toed cautiously to
      the door, turned the key, and threw it open before he could recover
      himself, for he had lost all sense of direction and could see nothing. She
      took the immediate risk of drawing the key from the door, to ward off the
      greater danger of pursuit, and calmly locked him in. If screams were as
      ineffectual as he had insisted, he would take little good from his
      battering of the door for some time to come. Frances now threaded her way
      through the maze of passages, meeting no one, for the gloom of death
      pervaded the palace, at least in the direction she had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared not hurry, in spite of the urging of her quickly beating heart,
      but must proceed leisurely, as if she had a perfect right to be where she
      was, should any inquisitive servant encounter her. At last, with a deep
      breath, she emerged upon the great courtyard and so came to the gate. The
      officer bowed to her, and she paused for a moment to thank him for his
      kindness to her in the earlier part of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true&mdash;that&mdash;that Lord Strafford&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She could
      get no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lady, and grieved we all are that it should be so. This morning
      on Tower Hill. The Lords refused a reprieve even until Saturday.&rdquo; Frances
      bent her head and struggled with herself to repress undue emotion, but,
      finding that impossible, turned abruptly and walked fast down Whitehall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her bright eyes, bless her!&rdquo; said the officer to a comrade, &ldquo;are not the
      only ones dimmed with tears for this morning&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the inn Frances thought of waiting for the faithful Vollins,
      but she had not the heart to meet him, nor the inclination to rest another
      night in the city now so hateful to her. She wrote a letter which was
      forwarded to him by a messenger, but said nothing of her visit to
      Whitehall, telling him his estimate of De Courcy had been correct,
      promising to send the thousand pounds to be replaced in her father&rsquo;s
      treasury as soon as she reached her home in the North, and asking pardon
      that his counsel had been declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later Frances was on her way to the North. She paused on
      Highgate Hill and looked back on the Babel she had left, vast and dim in
      the rising mist of the mild spring evening. &ldquo;Oh, cruel city! Oh, faithless
      man! The bloodthirst of London may be whetted and not quenched, perjured
      King of England!&rdquo; She bowed her head to her horse&rsquo;s mane and wept
      helplessly.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>illiam Armstrong
      rode his splendid black steed like one more accustomed to the polishing of
      saddle-leather than to the wearing out of the same material in the form of
      boots. Horse and man were so subtly suited, each to each, that such
      another pair might well have given to some early artist the first idea of
      a centaur. Armstrong was evidently familiar with the district he
      traversed, for he evinced no surprise when, coming to the crown of a
      height, he saw in the valley below him a one-storied stone building, whose
      outhouses and general surroundings proclaimed it a solitary inn, but the
      horse, less self-contained, and doubtless more fatigued, thrust forward
      his ears and gave utterance to a faint whinny of pleasure at the near
      prospect of rest and refreshment. The hand of the rider affectionately
      stroked and patted the long black mane, as if in silent corroboration of
      the animal&rsquo;s eager anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was as fair as his mount was dark. A mass of yellow hair
      flowed out from under his Scot&rsquo;s bonnet and over his broad shoulders. A
      heavy blonde moustache gave him a semi-military air; a look of the
      cavalier; as if he were a remnant of that stricken band across the border
      which was fighting for King Charles against daily increasing odds; but
      something of jaunty self-confidence in Armstrong&rsquo;s manner betokened that
      the civil war raging in England was no concern of his, or that, if he took
      any interest in it, his sympathies inclined toward the winning side, as
      indeed was the case with many of his countrymen. His erect bearing, body
      straight as one of his native pines, enhanced the soldier-like appearance
      of the horseman, and it needed but a glance at his clear-skinned but
      resolute face and powerful frame to be convinced that he would prove a
      dangerous antagonist to meet in combat, while the radiant good-nature of
      his frank countenance indicated a merciful conqueror should victory fall
      to him, as seemed likely unless the odds were overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both prowess and geniality were on the instant of being put to the test as
      he approached the inn, where a wayfarer is usually certain of a welcome if
      he has but money in his pouch. A lanceman, his tall weapon held upright,
      stepped out into the road from the front of the closed door before which
      he had been standing, when he saw that the traveller was about to halt and
      dismount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be fur dawnerin&rsquo; on a bit faurer forret,&rdquo; hinted the sentinel in a
      cautious, insinuating manner, as if he were but giving expression to the
      other&rsquo;s unspoken intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wise man halts at the first public-house he comes to after the sun is
      down,&rdquo; replied Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; a man&rsquo;s no verra wise that stops whaur he&rsquo;s least wanted,
      if them that&rsquo;s no wantin&rsquo; him has good airn in their hauns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, my lad, steel &rsquo;s a bonny argument, rightly used. Whut&rsquo;s a&rsquo;
      th&rsquo; steer here, that a tired man, willin&rsquo; to pay his way, is sent doon th&rsquo;
      rod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong adopted for the moment a brogue as broad as that of his
      questioner. He flung his right leg across the horse, and now sat sideways
      in his saddle, an action which caused the sentinel suddenly to grip the
      shaft of his pike with both hands; but the equestrian making no further
      motion, conversing in an easy nonchalant tone, as if he had little
      personal interest in the discussion, the vigilance of the man on guard
      partially relaxed, probably thinking it as well not to provoke so
      excellently equipped an opponent by any unnecessary show of hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, ye see, there&rsquo;s muckle folk in ben yonner that has mony a thing ta
      chatter aboot, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; Ah ken o&rsquo;t, except that Ah&rsquo;m ta let nane
      inside ta disturb them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose man are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah belong ta th&rsquo; Yerl o&rsquo; Traquair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very good friend of mine the Earl of Traquair is. Will you just go
      inside and tell him William Armstrong is sitting here on his horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wull Ah no, fur if th&rsquo; King himsel&rsquo; were ta ask, Ah munna let him by
      th&rsquo; door. Sa jist tak a fule&rsquo;s advice fur yince, and gang awa&rsquo; ta th&rsquo; next
      botha afore it gets darker an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re like to lose yer rod amang th&rsquo;
      hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get something for my horse to eat. He&rsquo;s done, and should not be
      pushed further. I&rsquo;ll wait outside until their lordships have finished
      their council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th&rsquo; stalls are a&rsquo; fou already, an&rsquo; if not wi better nags, at least wi the
      nags o&rsquo; noblemen, an&rsquo; Ah&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s neither you nor me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stalls may be fou, but my beast&rsquo;s empty, and I must get a feed of
      corn, noble or simple. Ye tell the Earl it&rsquo;s me and ye&rsquo;ll be thankit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma braw man, Ah tak&rsquo; orders fra the Yerl himsel&rsquo;, an&rsquo; fra nane
      else. Jist tickle yer beast wi&rsquo; the spur, or Ah&rsquo;ll gie him a jab wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
      point o&rsquo; this spear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The descent of young Armstrong was so instantaneous that the man-at-arms
      had no opportunity of carrying out his threat, or even of levelling the
      unwieldy weapon in his own defence. The horseman dropped on him as if he
      had fallen from the clouds, and the pike rang useless on the rough
      cobble-stones. The black horse showed no sign of fright, as might have
      been expected, but turned his intelligent head and calmly watched the fray
      as if accustomed to any eccentricity on the part of his master. And what
      the fine eyes of the quadruped saw was startling enough. The wide-spread
      limbs of the surprised soldier went whirling through the air like the arms
      of a windmill in a gale. Armstrong had grasped him by the waist and turned
      him end for end, revolving him, Catherine-wheel-wise, until the bewildered
      wits of the victim threatened to leave him through the action of
      centrifugal force. By the time the unfortunate sentinel lost all reckoning
      of the direction in which solid earth lay with regard to his own swiftly
      changing position, he found himself on his assailant&rsquo;s shoulder, gaping
      like a newly landed trout, and, thus hoisted aloft, he was carried to the
      closed door, which a kick from Armstrong&rsquo;s foot sent crashing inward. The
      intruder flung his burden into the nearest corner of the large room, as if
      he were a sack of corn; then, facing the startled audience, the young man
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong orders should have a stronger guard than, you set, gentlemen. I
      hold to the right of every Scotsman to enter a public dram-shop when he
      pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen amazed men had sprung to their feet, oversetting a chair or a
      stool here and there behind them, and here and there a flagon before them.
      Eleven swords flashed out, but the upraised right hand of the chairman and
      his commanding voice caused the weapons to hang suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man! By God, the very man we want! In the Fiend&rsquo;s name, Will,
      where have you dropped from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the back of my horse a moment since, as your henchman here will bear
      witness, Traquair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armstrong, your arrival at this juncture is providential; that&rsquo;s what it
      is, providential!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be, my Lord, for you did your best to prevent it. Your stout
      pikeman would not even let you know I was within call, so I just brought
      him in to give the message properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh, if he knew you as well as I do, he would have thought twice or he
      stood in your way. Come to the table, man, and fill a flagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll empty one with pleasure if the drawer will charge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no drawer, Armstrong, but wait on ourselves, trusting the lugs of
      a cogie rather than the ears of a scullion. So I&rsquo;ll be your cup-bearer,
      Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly, my lord, but I&rsquo;ll help myself, as my ancestor said to
      the Duke of Northumberland when he drove away the English cattle. The man
      who will not stretch an arm to slake a thirst deserves a dusty road all
      day with no bothy at the end of it.&rdquo; And, saying this, the young man drank
      long and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentinel had by this time got on his feet and was staring at the
      company like one dazed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your pike?&rdquo; demanded Traquair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the stanes ootside, ma lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, go out and lift it, and see that you hold a better grip of it
      when the next man comes along. Attend to Armstrong&rsquo;s horse, and keep an
      eye up and down the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after my own beast, Traquair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need for that, Will. We have matters of importance to discuss, and
      Angus here will feed the horse as well as you can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat and drink whatever&rsquo;s set before me, and never ask who is the
      cook, but I trust no man to wait on my horse. You bide by your sentry
      march, Angus, and I&rsquo;ll see to the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Armstrong strode out of the house, the ill-used sentinel
      following him. As the door closed, the interrupted hum of conversation
      rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who the interloper might be was the burden of the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armstrong&rsquo;s the very man for our purpose,&rdquo; said Traquair. &ldquo;If any one can
      get through Old Noll&rsquo;s armies by craft or by force, it is Will. I had no
      idea he was near by, or I would never have wasted thought on any other. I
      have known him for years, and there&rsquo;s none to match him, Hielan&rsquo; or
      Lowlan&rsquo;. We need seek nae farrar if Christie&rsquo;s Wull is wullin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never before heard of him,&rdquo; said the Reverend Alexander Henderson,
      of Edinburgh. &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he not done?&rdquo; asked the Earl. &ldquo;The Border rings with his fame,
      as it has rung with the fame of his ancestors these several centuries
      past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Border!&rdquo; cried the townsman, with the contempt of his class for
      the supposedly ignorant condition of that wild hilly belt which girded the
      waist of the land. &ldquo;We all know what brings a man renown on the Border.
      The chief requisites are a heavy sword and a thick skull. That the
      proposed excursion may require a ready blade at times, I admit, but a man
      who depends on that will not blunder through. There are too many of his
      kind opposed to him in Cromwell&rsquo;s army. It is not a wilderness like the
      Border that lies between here and Oxford, but a civilized country with
      cities, and men of brains in them. To win through and back requires skill
      and diplomacy, alertness of resource, as well as the qualities of riding
      hard and striking swift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Armstrong has all these qualities, and many more,&rdquo; replied
      Traquair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sample of his conduct just presented to us savors more of violence
      than of tact,&rdquo; objected Henderson. &ldquo;He comes breenging in on a private
      conference of his betters, carrying their sentinel on his head like a
      shambled sheep, and flings him in a corner. This proves him a strong man,
      but far from a wise one, because, for all he knew, he might have been
      walking into an ambuscade that would have cost him his life or liberty. It
      was pure luck and not foreknowledge that caused him to find a friend at
      our board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in the wrong there, Henderson, quite in the wrong, for you all
      heard him say that the sentry refused to bring in his message to me.
      Armstrong knew I was here, and thus was well aware he was safe enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson shook his head, stubbornly unconvinced. He was a man of talk
      rather than of action, and knew he spoke well, so, being a born objector
      to other men&rsquo;s proposals, his tongue was more active than his arm. When
      the unexpected &ldquo;breenging&rdquo; had occurred, every man in the room had jumped
      to his feet and grasped his sword, except Henderson, who sat staring,
      exhibiting little of that ready resource he had been commending. Now the
      danger was past, he apparently thought that after-eloquence made good the
      absence of energy in a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traquair, ever suave so long as he carried his point, showed no signs of
      irritation at this line of criticism, but made comment and gave answer in
      a low tone and persuasive voice. The others round the table kept silence
      and listened to the controversy between the man of language and the man of
      action, ready, doubtless, to side with whichever proved the victor. The
      Earl leaned his elbow on the board and gazed across at his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you here, Henderson. You are willing to admit there is no such city
      as Edinburgh between here and the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I need not try to convince you that Edinburgh is second to no town in
      the world so far as learning, judgment, and good sense are concerned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edinburgh is not in question, my Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll agree with all I say regarding it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are worse places than Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cautiously uttered, but true. Very good. Perhaps you will not dispute the
      fact that Lord Durie is one of your most enlightened citizens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Durie, Lord of Sessions? Durie&rsquo;s Decisions are well known in law, I am
      told. I have nothing to say against the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you differ from me, Henderson. I have much to say against him, be
      his Decisions never so good. He is, and always was, a prejudiced old fool,
      who, if he once got a wrong notion in his head, was proof against all
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak no ill against those in authority over us!&rdquo; cried Henderson,
      bristling into opposition now that a definite opinion was expressed. &ldquo;For
      twenty years he was chosen vice-president by the best men in all Scotland,
      none successfully opposing him, so you cannot say ill of such an one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Very</i> well, very well,&rdquo; coincided Traquair with suspicious haste, a
      faint smile parting his lips. &ldquo;We will take your word for it that his
      legal lordship is all you say. The point I wish to establish is that
      Edinburgh possesses an enviable shrewdness, and that Lord Durie is one of
      her most esteemed citizens. Other people may hold contrary opinion, but we
      defer to yours, Henderson. It chanced that one man holding contrary
      opinion so far as his lordship was concerned, and troubled with grave
      doubts regarding his impartiality, had a case coming before him that
      involved the litigant&rsquo;s possessions and lands. He knew that Durie was
      against him, and that there was no way of getting the thrawn deevil&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, Henderson&mdash;this upright judge&mdash;to listen to
      justice. This defendant slipped a word in Armstrong&rsquo;s ear to the effect
      that it would be most admirable if there was some other presiding judge at
      the Court of Sessions when the case was tried. The consequence was that
      Lord Durie, for the time being, disappeared and was accounted dead. The
      case was tried before his successor, and won by the contestant I have
      referred to, as was but right and just. Then Lord Durie came on the scene
      once more, to the joy of everyone but his successor, who should have been
      a friend of Will&rsquo;s if he wished the disappearance to have been permanent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you overstep the bounds of probability in order to establish a
      false proficiency for this ranting Borderer. &rsquo;Tis well known that
      Armstrong had nothing to do with the kidnapping of his lordship. The judge
      himself admits that the powers of evil spirited him away and kept him in a
      warlock&rsquo;s castle, hoping to lure him from the path of righteousness; but,
      his probity proving impregnable, they could not contend against it, and
      were fain to let him go again unscathed, for it is written, &lsquo;Resist the
      Devil and he will flee from you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Traquair leaned back and laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can take my word for it that he did not flee in this instance.
      When the judge was enjoying an airing, as was his custom, sitting his
      canny horse on Leith sands, Armstrong accosted him, also on horseback, and
      the two entered into amiable and instructive conversation. Old Durie was
      so charmed with his new acquaintance that he accompanied him to the
      unfrequented spot known as Frigate Whins, and there Will threw his cloak
      over the distinguished man&rsquo;s head, lifted him from his horse, and made off
      through a section of the country known better by himself than by any
      other, and where he was sure he was not like to meet gossiping stragglers.
      At last Will deposited his burden in the lonely Tower of Graham by the
      water of Dryfe, and there he remained for three months, not even seeing
      the people who fed him, for his meat was let down to him by a rope. As the
      judge&rsquo;s horse was found wandering on the sands, people came to the
      conclusion that his lordship had been thrown off, stunned, and drowned,
      the body being carried out to sea by the tide. In due time Armstrong took
      the gentleman back as he had come, and flattered the auld carle by telling
      him that, such was his learning and piety, Satan could not prevail against
      him. And so the learned judge just dawnered home with this idea in his
      head, which he speedily-got the wise city of Edinburgh to believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a wonder Henderson remained silent, but one of the others spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the incident well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if I am not mistaken the
      Tower of Graham at that time belonged to your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it does yet,&rdquo; replied Traquair nonchalantly. &ldquo;Armstrong, being
      an old friend of mine, had no hesitation in using my property without my
      leave, for, as he explained afterward, there was no time for consultation,
      the case being urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a most suitable place for the judge&rsquo;s custody,&rdquo; continued the
      other drily, &ldquo;because, unless a treacherous memory misleads me, a plea
      regarding this very property was decided in your favour by the single vote
      of the Lord President, who temporarily took the place of Justice Durie
      during his mysterious absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are quite in the right,&rdquo; replied Traquair, unabashed by the
      evident insinuation. &ldquo;It was my great good luck that the case against me
      was heard during Durie&rsquo;s absence, and, as you were doubtless about to
      point out, this world is full of strange coincidences which our poor
      finite minds fail to fathom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A finite mind easily probes the bottom of such a shameless conspiracy,&rdquo;
       cried Alexander Henderson sternly, bringing his fist down upon the table.
      &ldquo;What! Kidnap the Lord President of the Sessions, from the very edge of
      Edinburgh in broad daylight&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was drawing on to the gloaming at the time,&rdquo; corrected Traquair
      soothingly, &ldquo;at least so Will informed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nevertheless an outrageous action; a foul deed that should not go
      unwhipt of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Earl in a tone of authority, which seemed to recall
      the fact that, after all, he was the chairman of the conclave, &ldquo;we are
      wandering from the point. At this moment Lord Durie is reported to be a
      dying man, and whatever evil has been done against him in the long past
      probably troubles him less than the injustice he may himself have been the
      cause of. In any case we are met here together for a certain purpose, and
      what is said within this circle is said in confidence, for which our
      plighted words to each other stand sponsor. The crux of the discussion is
      this. Henderson objects to my man as the most fitting for our embassy,
      holding him to be a rude and brainless swashbuckler. That is a definite
      charge. I meet it by showing that this same man befooled the wise city of
      Edinburgh and the most learned man within its confines. A brainless
      bravado would have run a dirk into Lord Durie and left his body on the
      sands. I wish unanimous consent to tender our present dangerous mission to
      William Armstrong, in the hope that he may get safely to Oxford, and, what
      is more important, bring us with equal safety the King&rsquo;s written command.
      If any of you have some one else to propose, whom you think may accomplish
      his business better than Will Armstrong, I ask you to nominate the man and
      give reasons for your preference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson growled in his beard, but said nothing audible. Each man looked
      at the others as if waiting for some one else to make further suggestion;
      but, as the silence was prolonged, the one who had referred to the
      coincidence of Durie&rsquo;s incarceration with Traquair&rsquo;s case at law, cleared
      his throat and said that for his part it seemed that Armstrong was the
      proper man for the mission. With this the others agreed, and even
      Henderson gave an ungracious concurrence. The Earl was about to address
      the company when the door opened and Armstrong himself entered.

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;SUSPICION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>peak of the Devil,
      Wull,&rdquo; cried Traquair. &ldquo;We have been talking of you, my man, and we have
      some employment for you if you are ready for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Lord, there&rsquo;s no lack of that in these kittle times, for a
      fighting man gets civility and a welcome, whether in England or Scotland,
      whichever side he takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are for law and the King, against riot and rebels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, Traquair, I&rsquo;m not just a faction man, but am standing clear, to
      give both sides fair play, as the De&rsquo;il said when he was toasting the
      Elder on his fork, and changed his front to the fire. I suppose I am for
      the King, though I&rsquo;m not so prejudiced but I can see something to be said
      for the other side. It seems to me that the King&rsquo;s not exactly as wise as
      his predecessor Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s treason,&rdquo; roared Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not among friends who are most of them thinking the same thing,&rdquo; said
      Armstrong suavely. &ldquo;But no, I shouldna say that, for it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re
      all as loyal as my horse. Ye see, stranger, it&rsquo;s not to be expected that I
      should fling up my cap whenever the King&rsquo;s name is mentioned, for my
      family have stood the brunt of the battles on the Border this twothree
      hundred years, yet we got little thanks from any King for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a fine enthusiastic messenger to send on important business,&rdquo;
       growled Henderson to Traquair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would call your honour&rsquo;s attention to the fact that I am as yet no
      messenger at all, and if I am expected to be one it will be because of
      Earl Traquair and not on account of any sour Presbyterian that ever,
      thumped a pulpit in Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Armstrong calmly, quite accurately
      guessing the standing of the one who seemed to be the objecting element in
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crisis is this, William,&rdquo; broke in Traquair with visible impatience.
      &ldquo;There are papers that we must get through to King Charles at Oxford.
      Then, what is much more important, we must get his signed warrant back to
      us before we can act to any real purpose in this ploy. The victorious
      rebels pretend that they are fighting for certain so-called liberties, but
      we have reason to know that their designs run much deeper, that they aim
      at nothing less than the dethronement and possible murder of the King. It
      is necessary to get proof of this to the King, and to obtain his sanction
      to certain action on our part; for if we move without his written
      commission, and our plans fail, we are like to get short shrift from
      Cromwell, who will deny us the right of belligerents. Whether the King
      believes this or not, the documents we wish to send him are less to the
      purpose than that you should bring back to us his commission, so you will
      know that your home-coming is much more vital to us than your out-going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Still, if they kill me on the road there, it is not likely I will
      win my way back, so both journeys are equally vital to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be travelling through a hostile country, but nevertheless will
      find many to favour you; for though the land is under the iron hand of
      Cromwell, he is far from pleasing all the people, although they may make a
      quiet mouth save a doubting head. Brave as you are, Will, it is on the
      smooth tongue rather than on the sharp sword that you must depend; for,
      however many silent friends we may have along the route, there are too
      many outspoken enemies for even you to fight your way through. Have you a
      good horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pick of my stables is at your choice. Had you not better take a spare
      animal with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That would be advertising the importance of my journey. If I can get
      through at all, it must be by dawnering along as a cannie drover body,
      anxious to buy up cattle and turn an honest penny by selling them to those
      who want them worse than I do; a perfectly legitimate trade even during
      these exciting times. They all know the desire of a humble Scotsman to
      make a little money, though the Heavens and Kings be falling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an admirable idea, and you know the country well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one better. Indeed I&rsquo;ll trade my way to the very gates of Oxford if
      time is not too great an object with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time <i>is</i> an object, Armstrong, but you will have to do the best you
      can, and we shall await your return with what patience we may. You will
      tackle the job then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the kind of splore I like. Can you allow me three weeks or a
      month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you &rsquo;re back inside of a month, Will, you &rsquo;ll have done
      what I believe no other man in all Scotland could do. Well, that&rsquo;s settled
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bide a wee, bide a wee,&rdquo; cautioned Henderson, who during this
      colloquy had been visibly fuming under the contemptuous reference
      Armstrong had uttered regarding him. &ldquo;This man may be brave enough, but I
      doubt his judgment. He may have all the wisdom he traitorously denies to
      the King, but it&rsquo;s by no means proven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not deny wisdom to the King, Mr. Pulpiteer. I said Solomon was the
      wisest of men, except that he was a little daft on the marrying, and in
      that I&rsquo;m wiser than he, for whether Cromwell catch me or no, none of the
      lassies have caught me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ribald,&rdquo; shouted the minister angrily, &ldquo;and would add blasphemy
      to disloyalty. I was speaking of King Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was speaking of King Solomon, and speaking in a lower tone of voice
      as well. But while we are discussing wisdom, why are you all met here in
      this bothy, instead of in your own castle, Traquair? This innkeeper is a
      treacherous, canting dog. I know him of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson thought it would be safer here than at my house. I&rsquo;m being
      watched. We conceived it would be less conspicuous if the dozen of us
      gathered here as if by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were as sure of your messenger as I am of the innkeeper,&rdquo;
       protested Henderson, his growing dislike of Armstrong not to be concealed.
      &ldquo;The innkeeper is a pious man who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Judas; and he was one of the Apostles,&rdquo; interrupted Armstrong
      flippantly, unheeding the other&rsquo;s anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an enemy of your friends, the cattle-thieves,&rdquo; insisted Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? In that case you&rsquo;ll know more about him than I do, and I suppose
      it is policy for you to stand up for him. But, Traquair, I wonder at you!
      Did you search the house before you sat down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went round the steading, and there was no guard at the back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angus is keeping watch, and can see up and down the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road is the last place I would set foot on if I were a spy. You have
      been ranting in here at a great rate. Before I came to you I could hear
      every word that was said. One would think it was a Presbyterian convening,
      agreeing on the Scriptures. I knew Henderson&rsquo;s opinion of me before I
      opened the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like an eavesdropper,&rdquo; retorted the man referred to, &ldquo;and that
      you have a libellous ungoverned tongue is proven by every word you utter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; cried Traquair, &ldquo;let us have no more bickering. This is
      serious business and not to be settled by bandying words. Now, Armstrong,
      the case stands like this. Will you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl was interrupted by a roar from the sentinel outside, which caused
      every man in the room to start to his feet; but before they could move,
      Angus came bursting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody dropped from the hole on the loft above the stables, an&rsquo; wuz aff
      ta th&rsquo; wood afore I could stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To horse!&rdquo; cried Traquair. &ldquo;Mount instantly, and let&rsquo;s after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless, my lord,&rdquo; said Armstrong quietly, the only unexcited man in
      the group. &ldquo;Ye might as well look for some particular flea in all the
      Hielans. He&rsquo;ll have a horse tied to a tree, and a thousand cavalry
      couldn&rsquo;t catch him if he knows the wilds hereabout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be just some vagrant sleeping in the straw. The loft above the
      stables is not the loft above this room,&rdquo; put in Henderson; but it was
      plain that he was frightened. He loved a real eavesdropper as little as
      did any of his comrades, and knew he had talked rather loudly at times,
      carried away by his fondness for opposition. Traquair stood frowning and
      indecisive, his hand on the hilt of his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the landlord?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;Angus, bring him in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentinel left the room and speedily reappeared with a cowering man,
      evidently as panic-stricken as any of his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have there been some stragglers about to-day?&rdquo; demanded Traquair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul, my lord, on my oath, not a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there connection between the room above and the loft over the stable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No possibility of it, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; said Henderson, plucking up courage again. &ldquo;This
      turmoil is utterly without foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it!&rdquo; cried Armstrong with a gesture of impatience. &ldquo;Will you take a
      man&rsquo;s word for a thing you can prove in a moment? Get a ladder, Angus, and
      speel up through the hole the spy came out at. Take a torch, an&rsquo; if ye
      drop a lowe in the straw you&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be blamed for it by me. See if you can
      win your way through from the stables to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go at once, Angus,&rdquo; commanded Traquair; then to the landlord, who showed
      signs of wishing to be elsewhere. &ldquo;No; you stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feared th&rsquo; man wull set fire ta the place,&rdquo; whined the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be feared o&rsquo; the rope that will be round your neck if you have
      lied to us,&rdquo; said the Earl grimly, and as he spoke they heard the tramp of
      the sentinel&rsquo;s feet overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Angus?&rdquo; asked Traquair in an ordinary tone of voice. &ldquo;Can
      you hear what I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, ma lord. There&rsquo;s a very cunnin&rsquo; trap &rsquo;tween th&rsquo; stable
      loft an&rsquo; this, that one would na hev foun&rsquo; in a hurry, but the thief left
      it open in his sudden flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lips of the landlord turned white, but he remained motionless, panting
      like a trapped animal, for the giant form of Armstrong stood with his back
      against the door, the only exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Come down,&rdquo; said Traquair quietly. When the sentinel returned,
      Traquair bade him get a rope and tie the innkeeper hand and foot, while
      the prisoner groveled for his life, his supplications meeting with no
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now take him outside, Angus, and if there is any attempt on his part to
      move, or if there is an alarm of rescue, run him through with your pike
      and retreat on us. As for you, you false knave, your life will depend on
      your lying quiet for the moment and on what you tell us hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I ta be ta&rsquo;en awa&rsquo;, your merciful lordship?&rdquo; sobbed the man, who, now
      that his life seemed in no immediate danger, turned his anxiety toward his
      property. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll become o&rsquo; th&rsquo; inn, for there&rsquo;s nane here to tak care o
      &rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care o&rsquo;t, never fear,&rdquo; replied Traquair grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stalwart Angus dragged the man out, and the door was once more closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we may venture to seat ourselves again,&rdquo; said Traquair, suiting
      the action to the word. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to be done, and pursuit is
      hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All sat down with the exception of Armstrong, who remained standing with
      his back to the door, gazing somewhat scornfully on the conclave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perhaps now agree with me, Henderson,&rdquo; continued the Earl
      smoothly, &ldquo;that we are in no position to set up our collective wisdom as
      an example to William Armstrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may at least say,&rdquo; returned the minister sourly, &ldquo;that nothing whatever
      is proved. It is all surmise, suspicion, conjecture. The man who went away
      may well have been some lout sleeping in the straw, and no spy at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no conjecture about the fact that the landlord lied to us. There
      is no surmise in my belief that he thought his trap-door was securely
      closed, when he lied the second time, and that the secret of the trap-door
      was in possession of the man who escaped. This is proof enough for me, and
      I think it is equally convincing to the others. Have you anything further
      to urge against the selection of Mr. Armstrong as our messenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, Traquair, have it your own way. I dare say he will do as
      well as another,&rdquo; replied Henderson with the air of one making a great
      concession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo; proclaimed the Earl with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me, Traquair,&rdquo; began Armstrong, &ldquo;for you know I would be
      glad to forward anything you had a hand in, short of slipping my neck into
      a noose; but at that point I draw back. I&rsquo;ll not set foot on English soil
      now, King or no King. Henderson may go and be damned to him, for the
      useless, brainless clacker he is. If Cromwell hangs him, his loss will be
      Scotland&rsquo;s gain. Man, Traquair, I wonder at you! The lot of you remind me
      of a covey of partridges holding conference in a fox&rsquo;s den.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to defend the covey of partridges, Will; but, after all&rsquo;s
      said and done, the danger&rsquo;s not so much greater than it was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m fool enough to set face south when there&rsquo;s a spy
      galloping ahead of me with full particulars of every item in my wallet?
      Not me! It was bad enough before, as you say; now it&rsquo;s impossible. That
      is, it is impossible for me, for the flying man knows all about me. No;
      the proper thing to do is to meet at your castle, or some other safe
      place, and choose a man whose name and description are not in the wind
      ahead of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve known you to clench with quite as dangerous a task before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the danger, Traquair, as much as the folly, that holds me back.
      I&rsquo;ve been in many a foolish scramble before now, as you have hinted; but I
      learn wisdom with age, and thus differ from our friend Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will nothing change your decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; nothing in the world; not anything even you can say, my lord. I
      advise you to take a lad of Henderson&rsquo;s choosing. Any trampling ass may
      break an egg, but, once broken, the wisest man in the kingdom cannot place
      it together again. To-night&rsquo;s egg is smashed, Traquair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot blame you; I cannot blame you,&rdquo; said the Earl dejectedly,
      drawing a deep sigh. Then, turning to the others, he continued,
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, there&rsquo;s no more to be said. We must convene again. Would
      to-morrow, or the day after, be convenient for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that the meeting should take place two days from that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; said the Earl to Henderson, &ldquo;that I have no other candidate
      to propose, and will confine myself to agreeing with whatever resolution
      you come to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry with me, Traquair?&rdquo; asked Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least, Will. I appreciate your point of view, and were I in
      your place I should have reached exactly the same conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must beg a bed from you to-night. I have no wish to stay in this
      place, and if you are bent for home, as I surmise, I&rsquo;ll just trot my nag
      alongside o&rsquo; yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was this moment going to ask you, for I confess I&rsquo;ll ride the safer
      that your stout arm is near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company left the inn together, and in the middle of the road, before
      the house, they found Angus, with a torch, standing guard over a shapeless
      bundle huddled at his feet. The bundle was making faint pleadings to the
      man-at-arms, to which that warrior was listening with stolid indifference.
      The murmurs ceased as the group of men drew near. Traquair extended a
      cordial invitation to all or any to spend the night at the castle, which
      was the nearest house, but the others did not accept. Each man got upon
      his horse, and some went one direction, and some another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fling your lighted torch into the loft,&rdquo; said Traquair to Angus, &ldquo;that
      will prevent this woif worrying about his property. When you&rsquo;ve done that,
      throw him across your horse and follow us. Has there been sign of any one
      else about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma lord,&rdquo; replied Angus, promptly obeying the injunction about the
      torch. He then tossed the howling human mass in front of his saddle,
      sprang into his seat, and went down the road after the two who preceded
      him, the flames from the burning bothy already throwing long shadows
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Traquair, chagrined at the temporary defeat of his plans,
      inwardly cursing the stupidity of those with whom he was compelled to act,
      rode moody and silent, and this reserve the young man at his side made no
      attempt to interrupt until they had reached a slight eminence, where the
      nobleman reined in his horse and looked back down the valley at the
      blazing steading, which now filled the hollow with its radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will wait here till Angus overtakes us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This bonfire may
      collect some of the moths, and it&rsquo;s better travelling three than two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not far to go,&rdquo; said Armstrong, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a blessing, for I&rsquo;m on
      a long jaunt in the morning, and would be glad of my bed as soon as may
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; asked the Earl indifferently, gazing anxiously
      down the road for a sight of his follower, who was not yet visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong replied with equal nonchalance, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just away for Oxford,
      to carry a message from Lord Traquair to the King of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried his lordship, nearly starting from his saddle in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely my talk before these cuddies did not mislead you? I&rsquo;ll take your
      message through and bring you back an answer, if the thing&rsquo;s possible, but
      I cannot have those fools pottering and whispering in the matter. They
      must know nothing of my going. You will meet them two days hence, accept
      whomsoever they propose, and let him blunder along to a rebel gallows. It
      will be one blockhead out of the way, and then wise folk can do their bit
      travels unmolested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I send papers with him when they&rsquo;ll be in your pouch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and that they will not be. This night&rsquo;s work compels one to a
      change of programme. I shall carry no papers with me. If you let me read
      them I&rsquo;ll remember every word, though they be as long as the Psalms. I&rsquo;ll
      repeat them to the King with as few slips as any man in the realm. If you
      have a password or sign, or if you can tell me some incident that only you
      and the King know of, which will assure him that I am from you, everything
      else will be plain plodding. It would be folly for me, now that Cromwell&rsquo;s
      spy is on the gallop, to carry a line of writing that bears relation to
      politics. I&rsquo;ll be arrested before I&rsquo;m a mile beyond the Border, so my
      chance of getting through will depend on the search they make. If they
      find nothing it is likely they&rsquo;ll let me go, and I must manage to get back
      as best I can. There&rsquo;s no sense in being hanged for a spy the first day I
      set out. I&rsquo;ll leave that for Henderson&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, if I give the papers to him, they&rsquo;ll never see Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never see Carlisle, let alone Oxford. If I were you I would give
      him whatever papers you wish delivered direct to Cromwell. That will put
      Henderson and his gang off the scent, and your information may be of much
      pleasure and profit to General Noll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl laughed heartily, his spirits rising surprisingly at this
      intimation of the young man&rsquo;s resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armstrong, you&rsquo;re a hero. You shall read the papers to-night, and look
      over them again in the morning. The important matter is to get the King&rsquo;s
      commission back to us. Ah, here is Angus with his sack, so we&rsquo;ll say no
      more until we reach the castle.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;DETENTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning,
      early, William Armstrong, on Bruce, his black horse, set out for the
      Border with the good wishes of his host. His naturally gay demeanor was
      subdued, and he muttered to himself with wrinkled brow as he rode along.
      This unwonted abstraction was not on account of the danger which he knew
      lay ahead of him, but because he was committing to memory the message to
      the King. He carried a mass of notes, which he had written the night
      before, and these he consulted every now and then, for his horse required
      no guidance, and if it had, its rider was so accustomed to the saddle that
      he could have directed the animal in his sleep, for Bruce needed no tug at
      rein, but merely a whispered word or a touch from one knee or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night after he left Traquair&rsquo;s castle Armstrong slept on Scottish
      soil, still busy with his task of memory; then he burnt the notes in the
      fire that cooked his supper. It was scarcely daylight when he faced the
      clear and rippling Esk, and after crossing the stream to &ldquo;fell English
      ground&rdquo; he halted his horse on the southern shore and cast a long look at
      the hills of his native country, as one who might be taking farewell of
      them. Then, with a sigh, he turned to his task and sent no further glance
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A main road lay white and deserted before him, and the country he
      travelled, although in general feature similar to that he left, had
      nevertheless a subtle difference which always appealed to his inner sense
      whenever he crossed the line, but it was an evasive difference, which he
      would have found impossible to describe in words. The same discrepancy
      marked the language of the northern Englisher, which to a stranger would
      have seemed identical with that of his neighbours, but to Armstrong&rsquo;s
      sensitive ear the speech struck alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at a forking of the road, both branches tending south, he paused
      and pondered. Which should he take? He knew them equally well. The main
      road led to Carlisle, and in time of peace would have been preferable; the
      other, less direct, would probably carry him further in these uncertain
      times. The country showed no sign of the devastation of civil war, unless
      it was the absence of a population, and a deserted condition of the
      thoroughfares. That he could avoid contact with the Parliamentary forces
      was impossible, whichever road he took, and the question now demanding
      solution was not so much his direction as whether it were well to bring on
      his inevitable encounter with the Cromwellites sooner or later. The
      Carlisle route promised the speedier run into the arms of the enemy, but
      by the other route he would have more chance of bargaining about cattle,
      and thereby giving colour of truth to his statement that he was an
      innocent Scots drover, anxious to turn an honest penny. When questioned by
      an officer he could then say he had endeavoured to deal with so-and-so,
      and later investigation would prove the fact. But to an observer he bore
      the attitude of a stranger who had lost his way. This was evidently the
      conclusion arrived at by an object hidden in the hedge which had proved
      his night&rsquo;s lodging. The object sprang out across the ditch with a
      suddenness that made the horse start and snort in alarm, to be soothed by
      the gentle pat of its rider&rsquo;s hand, for the imperturbable Armstrong seemed
      surprised at nothing that took place. The object had the wild, unkempt
      appearance of one who habitually slept out of doors. His long and matted
      hair, emaciated face, and ragged beard, no less than his tattered
      clothing, or covering rather, made up of odds and ends of various
      costumes, formed a combination by no means attractive. He held in his
      hand, grasped by the middle, a long stick, somewhat taller than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gay gentleman,&rdquo; he cried cheerfully, &ldquo;will you pay the price of a
      fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the fool?&rdquo; asked Armstrong with a smile. &ldquo;You or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many of us, and someone is always paying the price. That is how
      I get a little money now and then. England is paying the price of a fool,
      and has been for some years past; paying heavily too, for all fools are
      not as cheap as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you who the fool was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is a question you may have to answer yourself,&rdquo; cried the
      object, with a cunning leer in his shining eyes. &ldquo;Beware how you answer
      it, for if you give the wrong answer, the price you pay is your head. &lsquo;Who
      is the fool?&rsquo; says you. That is the point, but whoever he is, we are
      paying for him with fire and sword and good human lives. Wherever there&rsquo;s
      strife, look for the fool that caused it, but be cautious in naming him.
      Which road are you going to take, my gay gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just switherin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re from Scotland. They tell me they grow a fine crop of fools
      there. The road on the right leads to Carlisle, and the fool&rsquo;s name in
      that direction is the King. The safest way is the one you came, and the
      fool&rsquo;s name there is like to be Cromwell, so they tell me. Am I to get the
      fool&rsquo;s price for advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven &rsquo;t given me any so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The advice all depends on what you pay for it. Let me see the coin, then
      I&rsquo;ll show you my wares. We differ in this, that I&rsquo;ll take whatever you
      give me, but you can take my advice or not, as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horseman threw him a coin, which the object clutched in mid-air with
      great expertness and examined eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, gay gentleman. The advice is to turn your fine horse end for
      end, and get back among the fools of your own kidney. We are always safer
      among our own kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any cattle for sale hereabout? I see none in the fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s for sale in England, crown, cattle, opinions, swords; oh,
      it&rsquo;s a great market for cutlery. But the price is uncertain and various.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s cattle, not cutlery, I want to buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes sell cattle myself,&rdquo; said the object, with a cunning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not seem a very prosperous business then. Where do you get your
      stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I pick it up on the roads. You&rsquo;ll find no cattle on the way to
      Carlisle. The country is swept bare in that direction. But I can lead you
      to a fine herd if you make it worth my while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down this way. Come along. Are you after any particular breed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Anything there&rsquo;s money in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like me,&rdquo; said the vagrant with a laugh, as he strode off
      down the unfrequented road. The object walked with incredible speed,
      laughing to himself now and then, and Armstrong was forced to trot his
      horse to keep up with him. On arriving at a slight eminence the guide
      waved his long arm toward a steading in the valley, which looked like a
      deserted group of farm buildings, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fine lot of
      cattle down yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see no signs of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! They&rsquo;re well stabled. Nothing lasts in the fields nowadays.
      They&rsquo;re not such fools as that. This herdsman knows when to keep his
      beasts in shelter.&rdquo; And with this the vagabond raised a shrill shout that
      echoed from the opposite hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying like that for?&rdquo; asked Armstrong, without showing any
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just to let the farmer know we&rsquo;re coming. Always give friendly
      warning in these parts, and then you may not get something in your inside
      that&rsquo;s hard to digest. That&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s advice, and costs you nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cry meets with no response,&rdquo; said Armstrong, laughing at the shallow
      cunning of his treacherous guide, for his keen eyes noted crouching
      figures making way along the other side of a hedge, and he knew that if he
      went down the lane, at whose junction with the road the beggar stood with
      repressed eagerness, he would find himself surrounded. Nevertheless he
      followed without betraying any knowledge of the trap he was entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the farmhouse a voice cried sharply, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; and an armed
      man sprang up from behind the hedge, cutting off retreat, if such had been
      attempted. While the others made through the hedge to the lane, the
      tattered man as nimbly put the hedge between himself and his victim, as if
      fearing a reprisal, laughing boisterously but rather nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave Captain, I&rsquo;ve brought you a fine horse and a gay gentleman, and the
      two are for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who had cried &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; stepped forth from the shelter of the
      nearest outbuilding, a drawn sword in his hand, followed by two others
      with primed matchlocks, stolidly ready for any emergency. Four others
      closed up the rear coming down the lane. There was no mistaking the fact
      that the man with the drawn sword was an officer, even if the object had
      not addressed him as Captain, a salutation to which he paid no attention;
      for although his uniform showed little difference from that of his men, he
      had in his stern face the look of one accustomed to obedience. The
      horseman had drawn up at the word, and sat quite nonchalantly on his
      steed, as if this were an affair of no particular concern to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is William Armstrong,&rdquo; replied the rider simply. In spite of
      himself, the stolid face of the leader showed some surprise at this
      announcement, as if he knew the name and had not expected to hear it so
      frankly acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came across the Border this morning. I am a Scotsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a cattle-dealer, and as there is little doing in my own country I
      thought I would just see if business was better on this side of the line.
      This amusing lunatic said there was cattle for sale in the valley, and led
      me hither, for which service I paid him a trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so there is, and so there is,&rdquo; cried the lunatic; &ldquo;but the price was
      for my advice, not for the leading hither. I must get my pay for that yet.
      Aye, there&rsquo;s cattle for sale here, and I&rsquo;m the marketman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace to your folly,&rdquo; said the captain, scowling. Then curtly to the
      horseman, &ldquo;Dismount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong sprang to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sword,&rdquo; demanded the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weapon was handed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do cattle-dealers in your country carry arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the young man with a laugh, &ldquo;if they did not
      they would carry little money home with them. I not only carry arms, but
      know how to use them on occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask to see your papers giving you permission to travel in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none. Scotland is at peace with England, and a citizen of my
      country should not require papers in visiting England, any more than an
      Englishman would need the same to go from one end of Scotland to the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; growled the captain, &ldquo;you are well versed in the law. I hope you
      are engaged in no enterprise that is contrary to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Captain. If you are King&rsquo;s men, you maintain that you are
      upholding the law. If you are Parliamentary, you swear the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I surmise you are no King&rsquo;s men. But in any case, until, one or
      other of you have declared war against Scotland, or until Scotland has
      declared war against either of you, or both, you meddle with a free
      citizen of Scotland at your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps wisest to indulge in no threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not indulging in any. I am stating a plain, uncontrovertible fact,
      that would be held by none so stoutly as by General Cromwell himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then keep your dissertations on law until you see the General, which is
      like to happen before we are done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to have a discourse with that
      distinguished man. He is a fighter after my own heart, and I understand he
      is equally powerful in controversy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this order Armstrong not only made no objection, but assisted in its
      fulfilment. He took off his doublet and threw it to one of the men who
      approached him, then held his arms outstretched that another might, with
      greater ease, conduct his examination. A third paid minute attention to
      the saddlebags, and a fourth took the saddle itself off the horse. The
      search brought to light some papers which the officer scanned, gaining
      thereby much information regarding the price of stots, stirks, and such
      like, but what these articles actually were, the peruser of the paper had
      not the slightest idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a stot; a weapon?&rdquo; asked the captain suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way it is a weapon, or at least an engine of attack,&rdquo; replied
      William genially. &ldquo;A stot is a young bull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sober in your answers, sir. This business is serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it is. There never was much humour south of the Tweed, and you folk
      seem to have broad-sworded away what little you had of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a stirk? I ask you to be careful of your answers, for they are
      being recorded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to act as schoolmaster. A stirk is a steer or heifer
      between one and two years old. If my answer is not taken as an imputation
      on any of the solemn company here, I may add that a calf grows into a
      stirk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain glowered angrily at the unabashed prisoner, as one in doubt
      whether he was experiencing a display of brazen impudence or extreme
      simplicity. He asked no more questions concerning the papers found, but
      gave them to a subordinate and directed them to be tied together. He now
      took from his belt a folded sheet, opened it, and read its contents with
      care, glancing now and then at the man before him. Apparently the
      comparison was to his satisfaction, and he restored the document to its
      place with a grunt of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Bates ready? Tell him to come here,&rdquo; he said to the subordinate, who
      instantly disappeared, emerging from among the outhouses shortly with a
      young man on a fine horse, evidently a racer before that sport was
      abolished. The animal was impatient to be off, but the young fellow on his
      back curbed its eagerness with a master hand, as one born to the saddle.
      The captain had employed the interval in writing a brief despatch, which
      he now handed to the young horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride hard and give that to General Cromwell as soon as you can. In case
      you should lose it, tell him we have got our man, who crossed the Border
      this morning. Say we are bringing him to Corbiton Manor, as directed, and
      expect to reach there before dusk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth, without reply or salute, pocketed the paper, shook out the
      reins, and was off like the wind, Armstrong watching the pair with a glow
      of admiration in his eyes. Although unused to the life of a camp, he was
      much struck by the absence of any attempt at secrecy in the proceedings.
      There was no effort to bewilder the prisoner or make a mystery of the
      affair. That his advent had been expected was perfectly clear, and that a
      written description of his person had been distributed along the Border
      was equally evident. They had been watching for him, and now they had him.
      There was no military fuss about the matter, and apparently very little
      discipline, yet instant and unquestioned obedience without accompaniment
      of formal deference to authority or manifestations of salute to superiors.
      But underneath it all was a hint of power and efficiency. Armstrong
      realized that he was in the clutch of an admirably constructed human
      machine that knew what it wanted and went straight for it. No one had
      spoken except the captain, yet every man was on the alert to do what was
      required of him instantly, capably, and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a word from the captain a bugle-call rang out, and its effect was soon
      apparent. An accoutred horse was led to the captain, who sprang into his
      place with the ease of one accustomed to the feat, and from the buildings
      appeared something like a score of mounted troopers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get into your saddle,&rdquo; commanded the captain, addressing Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter tested the buckling, which a soldier had just finished, drew up
      the strap a point, then, with his foot in the stirrup, turned and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to consider myself a prisoner, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever questions you wish to put will be answered presently by one
      higher in authority than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must protest against this detention, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your protest will doubtless be considered by the officer I referred to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Cromwell, I surmise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or one delegated by him. Mount, we have far to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong leaped into the saddle, and the troop set off, with the captain
      at the head, and himself in the midst of it. There was no chance of
      escape, even if he meditated such an attempt, which apparently he did not.
      The direction tended south and east, and as the sun was setting they came
      to Corbiton Manor, a large country house, which was seemingly the
      headquarters of a considerable section of the army encamped in the
      neighbourhood. Into a room in this mansion Armstrong was conducted and
      left under guard, and he was pleased to see by the spread table that there
      was at least no design on the part of his captors to starve him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;PREPARATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he mansion of
      Corbiton was a large and rambling structure, two stories in height for the
      most part, although in some places it rose to three, as in others it
      subsided into one. It was built partly of stone, partly of brick, and
      partly of timber and plaster, with many gables, and picturesque windows in
      the wide extending roof. Each of its owners had added to it as his needs
      required or his taste dictated, and now it was composed of many styles of
      architecture; but the jumble, as a whole, was beautiful rather than
      incongruous, as might have been expected. Time, moss, and ivy had blended
      the differing parts into one harmonious mass. The house faced the south,
      fronting a broad lawn that had once been smooth and level as a table, but
      was now cut up by horse&rsquo;s hoofs. A mutilated sun-dial leaned from the
      perpendicular in the centre. One gable contained a wide and tall mullioned
      window, which had formerly been filled with painted glass, but the
      soldiers, knowing nothing of art, and strenuous against idolatry, had
      smashed many of the pictured panes, but, finding that glass, whether
      colored or plain, kept out wind and rain, they had partially remedied the
      results of their own enthusiasm by stuffing the apertures with
      gaily-colored cloths, remnants of doublets or silken trousers, until the
      window was a gaudy display of brilliant rags, the odds and ends of a
      cavalier wardrobe; and thus the gay gable, from being an allegory of the
      days of chivalry, had become typical of the ruin that had overtaken the
      cause of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Corbiton had been one of the first to fall in the Civil War,
      dashing with gallant recklessness against the pikes of the yeomen.
      Theoretically these coarsely garbed pikemen were the scum of the earth,
      cowardly dogs who, when they saw gentlemen bearing down upon them, should
      have turned and fled; but actually they stood grim and silent, and when
      the charge broke against this human rock, although many a lowly hut was
      then masterless, many a mansion was without an owner, Corbiton among the
      rest. Sir Richard, dying, paid the price of a fool, and in the struggle
      exacted the same tribute from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As evening drew on, the thin crescent of a new moon shed a faint
      mysterious light over the scene, as if it were a white sickle hung up in
      the sky, useless because there was no harvest in England to reap, save
      that of death. The dim lustre outlined the mansion, but failed to reveal
      the wounds it had received, and the aspect was one of peace, scarcely
      troubled by the footfall of a sentinel slouching along the grass in front,
      carelessly trailing his pike, with nothing of alert military manner about
      him. From one wing of the building came the somnolent drone of a hymn, but
      this was counterbalanced by the more intermittent hoarse chorus of a
      ribald song, mingled with a rattle of flagons from another part of the
      house, for the ale in the cellars was strong, and not all of the
      Parliamentary army were Praise-God-Bare-Bones. The torches within the
      house struck flamelike color from the remnants of the pictured glass in
      the great window, which gave a chromatic touch to an otherwise sombre
      scene unrelieved by the pallid half-light of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentinel stopped in his walk and stood for a moment by the battered
      sun-dial, listening. Faintly in the still night air came to him across the
      fields the beating of horses&rsquo; hoofs on the hard road. Striding athwart the
      broken lawn to an oaken door, he smote it with the butt of his pike,
      crying,&mdash;&ldquo;Peace within there; the General is coming.&rdquo; There was an
      instant hushing of the coarse song, then a laugh, and when some one in
      nasal tones raised the slow tune of a hymn the laughter became more
      uproarious, subsiding gradually, however, as voice after voice joined the
      drone. The sentinel now walked over to the main entrance, and said to some
      one within the hall,&mdash;&ldquo;I think the General is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The watchman now resumed his promenade, but he shouldered his weapon and
      marched more like a man on guard. Several officers came out of the hall
      and stood listening on the broken sward. From the darkness emerged three
      horsemen, two following a leader, a thickset man, who came somewhat
      stiffly to the ground, as if fatigued with hard riding. To the one who
      sprang to the bridle he said curtly,&mdash;&ldquo;See the horse well rubbed
      down, and in half an hour feed him with corn,&rdquo; Then to his two followers,
      &ldquo;Look to your horses first, and to yourselves afterward. Be ready in an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief officer now stepped forward and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will surely stop the night, Excellency? Everything is prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Did my order to stay the execution of Wentworth reach you in time,
      Colonel Porlock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency. I would not have ventured to execute him without your
      sanction, although the death sentence was the unanimous finding of the
      court martial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sentence was just. It may yet be carried out, or it may prove that
      the Lord has other use for him. Lead the way within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Cromwell gave no greeting to the different groups as he passed
      them, his heavy riding-boots swish-swashing against each other as he
      followed Colonel Porlock into the hall. He strode awkwardly, like a man
      more accustomed to a horse&rsquo;s back than a tiled floor. The Colonel led him
      into the great dining-room, one end of which was occupied by the shattered
      window, while the other was crossed by a gallery, and above all, very dim
      in the feeble illumination of two candles and some smoky torches, could be
      distinguished the knobs and projections of a timbered roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast room was almost completely bare of furniture, with the exception
      of a high-backed carved chair, which doubtless belonged to it, and a stout
      oaken table taken from some other part of the house, replacing the long
      hospitable board that had witnessed many a festive gathering, but which
      had been used for firewood by the troopers. The General gazed about the
      ample apartment for a moment, as one who had never seen it before,
      estimating his bearings with the shrewd eye of a practised soldier; then
      he pushed the table until it stood lengthwise with the room, instead of
      across, as before; glanced at the gallery and table, as if making some
      computation regarding their relative positions, drew up the chair and
      seated himself, setting the two candles by the edge farthest from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Captain Bent arrived with his prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency. He came at sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he sure of his man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears to be so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any papers found on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other prisoner, Wentworth, is little more than a youth, I am told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very young, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came he to be set on an important outward post that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no danger of attack, and I placed him there of deliberate
      purpose. He was most reluctant to go, making one excuse and then another,
      saying he was ill, and what not. For more than a month he has been under
      suspicion of communicating with malignants, although we had no direct
      proof. He had been seen stealing away from the domain of Lord Rudby, the
      chief of the disaffected in the district. On the night in question he was
      watched, and as soon as he supposed himself alone he deserted his post,
      put spurs to his horse, and rode straight across country to Rudby Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was arrested there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Excellency. An unlooked-for event happened. He rode out from the
      grounds of the Hall, fighting his way, as it appeared, against a band of
      Rudby&rsquo;s followers, who were attacking him, and ran into the arms of our
      men, who were watching for him. The attacking party, seeing, as they
      supposed, an unknown force of rescuers, turned and fled. The night was
      very dark, and the account of what took place is confused, but Wentworth
      was carried back to Corbiton, tried, and condemned for deserting while on
      duty and holding commerce with the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! What version did Wentworth give of the affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He maintained he was no traitor, but did not give any explanation of his
      absence from duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Rudby had surrendered all arms and had taken the oath to remain
      neutral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His men were armed with staves only, and so Wentworth, better equipped,
      held his own against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What view did the court take of this affray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They thought it merely a feint to cover the retreat of a discovered
      traitor. The night, as I said, was dark, and our men, being mounted, could
      not move silently. Knowing the house would be searched if Wentworth was
      hidden, this plan of seeming enmity against him was prepared beforehand,
      in case of discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old a man is Rudby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearing fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What family has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His two sons are supposed to be with the King at Oxford. There is one
      daughter at Rudby Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Is this the young man who is said to be a son of the late
      scoundrel, Strafford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that very blood is hatred of the people, contumely, and all arrogance.
      At heart he must be a Royalist And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;where
      was he brought up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the estate of Sir John Warburton, dead these some years back.
      Warburton was his grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Warburton estate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It adjoins the lands of Rudby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-h! Is the boy&rsquo;s mother living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. His only relative is a sister who seems to be the most bitter
      King-hater in all the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not a chance the boy was on his way to see his sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was thought not. She has been at liberty to visit him here, and has
      done so on various occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Wentworth ever been in action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, Excellency, and he acquitted himself bravely enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hanging back; no wavering in the face of the foe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph. Send Captain Bent to me with the papers. When he is gone, I wish
      you to bring me a trooper, some silent man who can be depended upon; an
      unerring marksman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Bent arrived he handed to the General the papers he had taken
      from Armstrong. Cromwell examined them with great minuteness by the light
      of the candles, then set them in a bunch on the table without comment of
      any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your prisoner resist at all, or make any attempt at escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made no protest then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said England and Scotland were at peace, that he therefore needed no
      passport; that his arrest was illegal, and that you would be the first to
      admit as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph. Was he thoroughly searched? Are you sure he had no other papers
      than these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Bring the man here. If the door is open, come in with him. If
      it is shut, wait until you are called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Captain left the room the Colonel entered with his trooper, who
      bore a matchlock. Cromwell dismissed Porlock, then said to the trooper,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      will take your place in that gallery and remain there, making no sound.
      Keep your ears shut, and your eyes open. A man will be standing before me.
      If I raise my hand thus, you will shoot him dead. See that you make no
      mistake, and I warn you to shoot straight. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trooper, without a word, mounted to the gallery, and the General,
      rising, went round the table, standing on the other side. &ldquo;Can you see
      plainly?&rdquo; he cried to the man aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better if both candles were at this end of the table, sir.&rdquo;
       Cromwell moved the farther candle to a place beside its fellow, then stood
      again on the spot his prisoner would occupy. &ldquo;That is well, sir,&rdquo; said the
      man in the gallery. The General walked to the end of the room, threw open
      the door, and returned to his seat in the tall chair with the carved back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;EXAMINATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Captain Bent
      entered the galleried room with his prisoner, he found Cromwell seated at
      the table, his head bowed over some pages of manuscript on which he was
      busily writing. The General did not look up for a full minute, until he
      had finished the sentence he was inditing, then he raised his head and
      said quietly to the captain: &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one brief and lamentable instant the discipline which held the captain
      in its bonds relaxed, and he replied in surprise,&mdash;&ldquo;And leave him
      unguarded, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell said nothing, but a look of such devilish ferocity came into his
      piercing grey eyes that the captain staggered as if he had received a
      blow, gasped, turned, and fled. When the Commander spoke to Armstrong
      there was no trace of resentment or anger in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you oblige me by closing that door which Captain Bent has stupidly
      left open? You are nearer it than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong with a bow did what he was requested to do, and returned to his
      place beside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I must begin with an apology, a form of speech to which I am
      unaccustomed. You have been stopped quite without just cause, and I trust
      you have met with no inconvenience or harsh treatment in consequence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With neither, General Cromwell, if I am not at fault in so addressing
      you. I jalous there are not two such men as you in the army of the
      Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell paid no heed to the compliment, if such was intended, but
      although his voice was suave his keen eye searched the prisoner like an
      east wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stoppage may indeed save you further annoyance if you intend to
      travel about the country, for I will give you a pass likely to prevent
      such a mistake in future. You are in the cattle-trade, I am told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is an honest occupation, and I am pleased to believe my army
      has ever been an upholder of it, paying for what it requires in sound
      money, even when the wages of the soldier were scant and in arrear. The
      requisitions and confiscations which have followed like a plague the track
      of the King&rsquo;s forces, devastating the country like the locusts of
      Scripture, are no accompaniment to the troopers of the Lord. It is perhaps
      your intention to deal with us rather than with the King&rsquo;s army, should
      you venture so far south?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I know little of English politics, and the man with money in his
      pouch, and a purchasing brain in his head, is the chap I&rsquo;m looking for, be
      he Royalist or Parliamentarian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a commendable traffic with which I have no desire to interfere. You
      know of no reason, then, for your arrestment by my stupid captain, Ephraim
      Bent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth to tell, your Honour, and I know a very good reason for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph. And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s brows contracted slightly, and the intensity of his gaze
      became veiled, as if a film like that of an eagle&rsquo;s eye temporarily
      obscured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some nights since, as I was making for the English line, I stopped for
      refreshment at an inn where I had been accustomed to halt in my travels.
      To my amazement I was refused admittance by a man who stood on guard. We
      had a bit of a debate, which ended in my overpowering him and forcing an
      entrance; and which was more surprised, the dozen there gathered together,
      or me with their sentry under my oxter, it would be difficult to tell.
      Swords were drawn, and I might have come badly out of the encounter had it
      not been that a friend of mine among the assemblage recognized me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of perplexity had overspread the grim face of the General as this
      apparently simple tale went on. He leaned his elbow on the table, and
      shaded his face with his open hand from the light of the two candles,
      thumb under chin, and forefinger along his temple. At this point in the
      discourse he interrupted: &ldquo;I suppose you wish to mention no names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no objection,&rdquo; continued Armstrong innocently. &ldquo;I take it that the
      men were quite within their right in gathering there, although I contended
      they exceeded their right in trying to keep me out of a public-house. My
      friend was the Earl of Traquair. The others I did not know, and I was not
      introduced, but in the course of the talk I gathered that the one who had
      the most to say was Henderson, a minister of Edinburgh, who spoke much, as
      was to be expected from his trade. Well, these gentlemen, finding I was
      for England, asked me to carry a message to the King, but I explained that
      I had no wish to interfere in matters which did not concern me, and they
      parted to meet again somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think in Lord Traquair&rsquo;s own castle, but of that I am not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is interesting. We shall, of course, try to prevent any messenger
      reaching the King; but I do not understand why you connect the incident at
      the inn with your detention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a great splore about a spy that escaped, and I have no doubt,
      if he saw me there, and heard the proposal made to me, he might well have
      brought my name and description across the Border. At least that was the
      way I reasoned it out with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very like you are right. Spies, unfortunately, seem to be necessary
      when a country is in a state of war. Many unjustifiable acts are then
      committed, including the arresting of innocent men; but I am anxious
      nothing shall be done that will give just cause of offence to Scotland; a
      God-fearing country, and a friendly. When such injustice happens, as it
      has happened in your case, I try to make amend. How far south do you
      propose to travel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may go the length of Manchester or Birmingham. The distance and the
      time will depend on the state of trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will tell me places you intend to visit, I will include them in
      the pass I shall now write for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot say just at the moment. I wish to follow trade wherever it
      leads me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then an inclusive pass, extending as far south as Manchester, will meet
      your needs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will more than meet them, General,&rdquo; said Armstrong with supreme
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commander took up his pen, but paused, and, still shading his face,
      scrutinized the man before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I am unlikely to see you again, perhaps it would be as well not to
      limit it to Manchester. You may wish to travel farther south when you
      reach that town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is barely possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you carry no message from Traquair to the King, I can write Oxford on
      your permit as easily as Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, General; but Manchester will be far enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may say that we are strict about those whom we allow to journey to and
      fro at the present time, and if you should overstep the limit of this
      document, you are liable to investigation and delay, and I may not be so
      near at hand on the next occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand, and if I wished to go farther south I would have no
      hesitation in begging permission of your Excellency; but I doubt if I
      shall even see Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be leaving Corbiton until the morning, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, General. I know when I am well housed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as I have much to do, I will make out your paper later, and it will
      be handed to you in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this the Commander rose, and himself accompanied Armstrong to the
      door in most friendly manner. The young man, in spite of his distrust, was
      very favourably impressed, for there had been nothing, in Cromwell&rsquo;s
      conversation, of that cant with which he was popularly accredited. The
      Scot had expected to find an English Alexander Henderson; a disputatious,
      gruff, tyrannical leader, committing acts of oppression or cruelty, and
      continually appealing to his Maker for justification. But Cromwell&rsquo;s
      attitude throughout had been that of the honest soldier, with little to
      suggest the fervent exhorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving some laconic instructions touching the welfare of the
      Northerner to Captain Bent, who was hovering uneasily in the outside hall,
      Cromwell, bidding his enforced guest a cordial farewell, ordered Wentworth
      to be brought to him, and retired once more into the dim council-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hands clasped behind him, and head bent, he strode slowly up and down
      the long room in deep meditation, vanishing into the gloom at the farther
      end, and reappearing in the limited circle of light that surrounded the
      two candles, for the torches had long since smoked themselves out, and
      there had been no replacement of them; none daring to enter that room
      unsummoned while the leader was within it. The watcher in the gallery felt
      rather than saw that there was an ominous frown on the lowered face as the
      Commander waited for the second prisoner, over whom hung sentence of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time a clanking of chains announced the new arrival, who was preceded
      by Colonel Porlock and accompanied by two soldiers, one on either side of
      him. The young fellow, who shuffled up to the table dragging his irons,
      cast an anxious look at the forbidding face of the man who was to be his
      final judge; in whose word lay life or death for him, and he found there
      little to comfort him. Cromwell seated himself once more and said gruffly:
      &ldquo;Take off those fetters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the command was complied with, the General dismissed the trio and sat
      for some moments in silence, reading the frank open face of his opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to be shot at daybreak to-morrow,&rdquo; he began in harsh tones that
      echoed dismally from the raftered ceiling. This statement contained no
      information for the youth, but the raven&rsquo;s croak sent a shiver through his
      frame, and somehow the tidings brought a terror that had been absent
      before, even when sentence of death was pronounced with such solemnity by
      the court. There was a careless inflection in the words which showed that
      the speaker cared not one pin whether the human being standing before him
      lived or died. Allowing time to produce the impression he desired,
      Cromwell continued in the same strain of voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have examined the evidence, and I find your condemnation just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy remembered that his father had met death bravely, asking no mercy
      and receiving none, and the thought nerved him. If this man had merely
      brought him here to make death more bitter by taunting him, it was an
      unworthy action; so, moistening his lips twice before they would obey his
      will, he spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never questioned the verdict, General, nor did I make appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shaggy brows came down over Cromwell&rsquo;s eyes, but his face cleared
      perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You own the penalty right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is partly right and partly wrong, like most things in this world.
      It is right to punish me for deserting my post; it is wrong to brand me a
      traitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have found your voice at last, and there is some courage behind
      it. Desertion is an unpardonable crime. The point I press upon you is
      this; your life is forfeit, yet, although your fault is unpardonable, I do
      not say it cannot be compensated for. Even my enemies admit I am an honest
      trader. I will bargain with you for your life. You shall buy it of me, and
      I shall pay the price, even though I do not forgive the crime. We will
      first, if you please, clear up the charge of treachery. You were visiting
      your own home that night, and as it is on the farther side of Rudby Hall,
      your accusers naturally thought you had a rendezvous there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, General; it was my intention to have visited Rudby Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The residence of that foul malignant, Lord Rudby, so called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not to see his lordship, who is my enemy, personal as well as
      political.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scowl vanished from the face of his questioner, and something almost
      resembling a laugh came from his firm lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are truthful, and it pleases me. Why did you make a foolish mystery
      of your excursions? I take the case to stand thus. Your grandfather and
      Rudby were neighbors, and possibly friends. You were, and are, in love
      with my lord&rsquo;s daughter, but since you belong to the cause of the people,
      this oppressor of the people will have naught of you. You have risked your
      life to see the girl, who is doubtless as silly as the rest of her class,
      as you will discover if I let you live. Stands the case not thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a measure, sir, it does, saving any reflection on the lady, who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely. I know what you would say, for I was once your age and as
      soaked in folly. The question is, if you will risk your life for her, will
      you do what I ask of you to earn the girl and your life, or will you
      refuse, and let her go to another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I will do anything for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then harken well. There was here before me, where you now stand, some
      moments since, the most plausible liar in the kingdom. He told me truths,
      which on the surface appeared to be treachery to his friend, but which he
      was well aware I already knew. This was to baffle me into believing him.
      He rides to Oxford to see the King, and in that I am willing to aid him.
      He may tell the King what pleases him, and those who send him,&mdash;little
      good will it do any of them. In return the King is to give him a
      commission, to be handed to certain lords in Scotland. If that commission
      crosses the Border, we are like to have a blaze to the north of us which I
      do not wish to see kindled until a year from now; then, by God&mdash;&mdash;-then,
      by God&rsquo;s will I shall be ready for them. We shall defeat the Scots in any
      case, but if this commission reaches these malcontents we cannot have the
      pleasure&mdash;humph!&mdash;we shall be precluded from the duty of
      beheading the ringleaders without bringing on ourselves the contumely of
      Europe. Without the King&rsquo;s commission they are but broilers&mdash;marauders.
      With this commission they will set up the claim that they are
      belligerents. Do you understand the position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commission must be intercepted at all costs. It will be your task to
      frustrate the intentions of the King and his Scottish nobles. But the task
      is more complicated than yet appears. It would be an easy matter to run
      this messenger through the body, and there an end. I want what he carries,
      but I do not wish to harm the carrier. These Scots are a clannish,
      troublesome, determined race. If you prick one with a sword&rsquo;s point, the
      whole nation howls. This, then, must be done quietly, so that we bring no
      swarm about our ears. William Armstrong is the messenger&rsquo;s name, and he
      has powerful supporters in his own country. He was stopped as soon as he
      crossed the Border yesterday, and brought here. He pretends to be an
      innocent trader in cattle, and will likely keep up that pretence. I have
      appeared to believe all he says, and he leaves this house to-morrow
      morning with a pass from my hand, giving him permission to travel as far
      south as Manchester, which was all he asked. I would willingly have given
      him safe conduct to Oxford, but he was too crafty to accept such a thing.
      He thinks he can make his way south from Manchester. As a matter of fact,
      he cannot, but I wish to make the way easy for him. Of course I could give
      a general order that he was not to be molested, but there are reasons
      against this, as we have doubtless spies in our own ranks, and a general
      order would excite suspicion, and would probably prove useless, because
      this man, south of his permit&rsquo;s territory, will endeavour to go
      surreptitiously to Oxford, and by unfrequented routes. It will be your
      duty to become acquainted with Armstrong and win his confidence. You will
      accompany him to Oxford and return with him. You will be protected by a
      pass so broad that it will cover any disguise either of you may care to
      assume. It is such a pass as I have never issued before, and am not like
      to issue again, so I need not warn you to guard it carefully and use it
      only when necessary. It reads thus:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the speaker took up a sheet of paper on which he had been writing,
      and, holding it so that the light from the candles fell upon it, read
      aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pass the bearer and one other without question or interference from
      Carlisle to Oxford and return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The journey south will give you the opportunity to become acquainted with
      your man. On the northward march you must become possessed of what he
      carries, and when you bring it to me you receive in its stead pardon and
      promotion. If you do not succeed before you reach Carlisle, then I must
      crush him; possibly kill him as a spy. Will you undertake it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is an ungracious office you would bestow upon me, sir. I had
      rather meet him in fair fight and slay him, or have him slay me, as God
      willed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks youth,&rdquo; cried Cromwell impatiently. &ldquo;This man is a
      treacherous, lying spy, whose life, by all the rules of war, is already
      forfeit. I propose to discomfit him with his own weapons. Nay, more; I
      willingly save him from the destruction he merits. You are set to do him
      the greatest service one man can offer another. If you fail, he dies. If
      you succeed, he has probably a long life before him. God knows I yearn to
      cut no man&rsquo;s thread where it can be avoided, but the true interests of
      England stand paramount. Would you condemn thousands of innocent men to
      agony and the horrors of prolonged war, to save the feelings of a Border
      ruffian who intervenes in a quarrel that should not concern him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are in the right, and your argument is incontestable. I accept
      your command willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of pleasure lit the rugged face of the General, for he was
      flattered to believe his prowess in controversy was no less potent than
      his genius in war. His voice softened perceptibly as he continued: &ldquo;We are
      enjoined by the Word to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the
      harmlessness of the dove. Your mission combines the two attributes, wisdom
      and harmlessness, for you are to beguile deceit, and yet suffer the
      deceiver to pass on his way scathless. You save your country, and at the
      same time save your country&rsquo;s enemy, forgiving them that persecute you.
      What excuse will you give to Armstrong for your desire to visit Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, the son of Lord Rudby, is there. Although we are on opposite
      sides, he has none of the bitterness against me shown by his father. I
      will say I wish to confer with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will serve. Now this pass is for two, and you can offer to Armstrong
      safe conduct under your guidance, giving what plea you choose for the
      absence of the man who was to accompany you, and who, it may be, was
      supposed to have procured this pass from me. Whatever difficulties arise
      on the journey must be met as they advance, and in so meeting them will
      come into play whatever gifts of ingenuity you may possess. If you show
      yourself worthy and diplomatic, there is scarcely limit to what you may
      attain in the councils of your country. The need of the future is capable
      men; men earnest in welldoing, energetic in action, prompt in decision,
      unwavering in execution. In the hope of finding you one such, I snatch you
      from the scaffold. The King cravenly bent your father&rsquo;s neck to the block,
      although he had shown himself to be the one strong man in his council; I
      arrest the order to fire at your breast, though you are yet unproven. See
      that you do not disappoint me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell folded the pass and handed it to young Wentworth. &ldquo;Go. This paper
      is your safeguard. I shall give the order that you are to be well mounted
      and provided with money. Send Captain Bent to me as you pass out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more alone, Cromwell wrote the pass for Armstrong, giving him
      permission to travel between Carlisle and Manchester. When he had finished
      writing, Captain Bent was standing beside the table, and to him he
      delivered the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give that to your late prisoner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is to depart
      to-morrow morning, not before eight o&rsquo;clock, and is to travel unmolested.
      You have accomplished your duties well, Captain, and your services shall
      not be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silent but gratified captain left the room with straighter shoulders
      than had marked his previous exit. His chief looked up at the dark gallery
      and called out, &ldquo;Come down and report yourself to the officer of the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For nearly ten minutes Cromwell sat at the table in silence, save for the
      busy scratching of his pen. Then he rose wearily, with a deep sigh, his
      marked face seemingly years older than when he had entered the room. Once
      outside, he gave Colonel Porlock the papers he had written, and said: &ldquo;The
      finding of the court martial is approved, but the sentence is suspended.
      It is possible that Wentworth may render such service to the State as will
      annul the sentence against him. You will give him every assistance he
      requires of you, and the amount of money set down in this order. Bring out
      my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will surely partake of some refreshment, General, before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My horse; my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the animal was brought to the lawn, the General mounted with some
      difficulty, more like an old man than a leader of cavalry. The two silent
      horsemen behind him, he disappeared once more into the night, as he had
      come.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;INVALIDATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ine o&rsquo;clock of a
      summer&rsquo;s morning in rural England is an hour of delight if the weather be
      fine. The birds sing whether there be war or peace in the land; the trees
      and hedgerows and the flowers make a path to fairy-land of the narrow
      lanes; but the man who trusts to these winding thoroughfares, unless he
      know the country well, is like to find himself in an enchanted maze, and
      Armstrong, stopping his horse at an intersection, standing in his stirrups
      the better to view the landscape, wrinkled his brow in perplexity and felt
      inclined to change his tune to the wail of his countryman lost in the
      crypt of Glasgow Cathedral, and sing,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;I doot, I doot, I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er win out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of galloping hoof-beats to the rear caused him to sink into his
      saddle once more and wait patiently until he was overtaken. As his outlook
      had shown him the woods surrounding the mansion he had left an hour before
      in an entirely unexpected direction, and at a distance not at all
      proportionate to the time he had spent on horseback, the thought occurred
      to him that his late detainers had changed their minds regarding his
      liberation and were pursuing him, but he was fortified by the knowledge
      that he possessed a permit written by Cromwell&rsquo;s own hand, which no one in
      that part of England would dare to disregard. If the oncomer should prove
      a private marauder, of which the country doubtless had many, the horseman
      reposed a calm confidence in his own blade that gave sufficient repose to
      his manner. He turned his horse across the lane, completely barring the
      way, and with knuckles resting on his hip awaited whatever might ensue.
      Premising a friendly traveller with knowledge of the district, he was sure
      of a clew out of the labyrinth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hastening rider came round a corner, curbing his animal down to a walk
      on seeing the path blocked. The two horses neighed a greeting to each
      other. Armstrong was pleased to note that the stranger was a youth with a
      face as frank and beaming as the day; a face to which his friendly heart
      went out at once with sympathy, for it seemed glorified by the morning
      light, as if he were a lover sure of a warm greeting from his lass, which
      was indeed the hope that animated the boy. The hope had displaced a
      chilling dread, and the transformation made this daybreak very different
      from the one he had expected to face. He was riding out from under the
      shadow of death into the brightness of renewed life and promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving as near the impeding horseman as he seemed to think safe, he came
      to a stand, and with a salutation of the hand made inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you stop me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question carried neither challenge nor imputation, for, the times
      being troubled, no man could be certain that he met a friend on the
      highway until some declaration was forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only so far as to beg of you some solution of the enigma of these roads.
      I am desirous of travelling southward, and seek a main highway, which I am
      grievously puzzled to find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have chanced on a better guide, for I was brought up some
      miles from this spot, although at the moment I am myself on a southern
      journey. We turn here to the right, but we have far to go before we reach
      the highway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more lucky am I, then, that you have overtaken me. &rsquo;T would
      need a wizard to unravel this tangled skein of green passages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried the youth with a lightsome laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often lost myself
      in their entanglements, and, what is more lasting, I lost my heart as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing you have not lost, and that is time. You are just
      young enough for such nonsense as the latter losing. I am older than you,
      and have lost my way before now, as you may well bear witness, but I have
      kept my head clear and my heart whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing to boast,&rdquo; said the boy, with an air of experience.
      &ldquo;It simply means that you have not yet met the right woman. When you meet
      her you will be in as great a daze as that in which I found you at the
      cross-roads. You will think it strange that I make a confidant in so
      personal a matter of a total stranger, but, truth to tell, if I am to
      guide you to the highway, you must bear me company through Rudby Park, for
      I hope to get a glimpse of my fair one before I ride farther toward
      Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward Oxford!&rdquo; cried Armstrong, instinctively reining up his horse in
      his surprise. &ldquo;Are you, then, making for Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been expecting a friend to come with me, but he is delayed, I
      suspect at Carlisle, so I must get on as best I can without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I travel to Manchester,&rdquo; said Armstrong, more non-committal than the
      other appeared to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be happy to bear you company, if it so pleases you, until we
      come to the parting of our ways. That is, if you are not in haste and can
      wait until I have a word with my lass, in whose direction we are now
      tending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this invitation the Scotsman made no reply, and the other began to fear
      he had been too forward in his proposal. He rattled on, striving to cover
      his error in a flood of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most winsome little lady in all the country side; the only
      daughter of Lord Rudby, who is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Rudby!&rdquo; echoed Armstrong. &ldquo;You fly high, my young sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not? Although she is the sweetest angel that ever visited
      this glad earth, she makes no descent when she joins her hand to mine. I
      am Thomas Wentworth, eldest son to the late Earl of Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been travelling knee to knee in the narrow way, but now Armstrong
      pulled up and looked at his companion in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the Minister to the King of England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There was no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are perhaps about to visit Charles at Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I have already told you more than was wise on so short an
      acquaintance,&rdquo; said Wentworth, trying another tack. &ldquo;You yourself gave me
      a lesson in reticence a moment since, and you have not been so garrulous
      concerning yourself as I. I do not even know your name, although I suspect
      your native land lies north of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am William Armstrong, and Scotland is my country. As two swords
      are better than one, I shall be most glad to travel in your company. I may
      say, however, that I hold a pass from Cromwell himself, so, if you are a
      King&rsquo;s man, you may not wish to be my companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who journeys in Hades must have the devil&rsquo;s leave,&rdquo; answered Wentworth
      jauntily. &ldquo;I am myself abroad through Cromwell&rsquo;s permission, and I&rsquo;ll
      venture my pass is broader as well as longer than yours. &rsquo;Tis
      sometimes well to have a friend in the enemy&rsquo;s camp, and my friend
      pretends he can get anything from Old Noll. Read it, if you think I&rsquo;m
      boasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wentworth handed the document to the Scot, who read and returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is but a limited permit compared with this. Where do you expect to
      encounter your comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear there is little chance of seeing him until I reach Oxford, if
      indeed I find him there. I suspect he is detained at Carlisle. However, I
      travel on my own business, and he on his, so it makes little difference to
      me, save the lack of companionship. War throws together strange
      fellow-travellers, and I do not inquire too minutely into his affairs, nor
      he into mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to Oxford alone then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of the way with you, I hope. Yes; I&rsquo;m tired of waiting, and so set
      out alone this morning, deviating from the main road and taking these
      lanes, the better to approach Rudby Hall without undue publicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Armstrong thoughtfully; then, as he fell into a meditation,
      there was silence between them for some time. The theme of his reflection
      was the accomplishment of the task which lay before him. Here seemed a
      heaven-sent opportunity to win peacefully to Oxford, and perhaps to return
      as far north as Carlisle. Once in Carlisle, with Bruce beneath him, he
      could defy the whole Parliamentary army to catch him before he crossed
      into Scotland. Even at the first, the frank, honest face of the boy and
      his cheerful loquacity went far to disarm suspicion; then the announcement
      of his name and rank led Armstrong to the erroneous conclusion that the
      youth of necessity belonged to the Royal cause, forgetting that many of
      the nobles were on the side of the people, some of them active officers in
      the Parliamentary army. Circumstances combined to lull his natural
      shrewdness and conceal from him the danger of his position. He thought
      Cromwell was satisfied that the wrong man had been arrested, and believed
      the General had been thus deluded because no incriminating papers had been
      found on him. The spy of the inn must have reported that the messenger to
      the King would carry important documents to Oxford. The search had been
      thorough, but of course the most minute examination failed to discover
      what did not exist. Armstrong&rsquo;s prompt acknowledgment of his name, his
      explanation of the mission proposed to him, his reasons for refusal, must
      have had their weight with Cromwell, and if the spy were re-questioned he
      would necessarily corroborate most of the details given. Cromwell&rsquo;s
      complaisance in the proffering of an unasked passport appeared to be, in a
      way, compensation tendered for injury done, or at least interference, by
      his followers. Armstrong remembered that luck had often stood his friend,
      and the present encounter looked like another instance of it, so he
      resolved to journey with Wentworth as far south as Manchester, there to be
      guided by circumstances. Up to that point he need ask for no favour, for
      he had his own permit to lean upon. If the lad proved a true companion, he
      might then venture to propose that they should keep together under
      protection of the pass for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you move on to Oxford at once, when you have seen this young lady?&rdquo;
       asked Armstrong, breaking silence at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and am willing to ride as hard as you like, if you are pressed for
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m in no hurry. He&rsquo;s a churl who would not wait while a lover and
      his lass whispered, and I shall do aught that I can to forward your
      adventure if there is any obstacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, but there is like to be no obstacle at this time of the day.
      I hope to have the good fortune to find her walking in the garden. This
      would simplify my quest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you forbidden the house, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a measure I am. I have my enemies within the walls, but my good
      friends also. If I get a word with one of the latter, difficulties will
      dissolve.&rdquo; Here the youth reined in his horse and sat for a moment
      anxiously scanning the landscape. A belt of tall trees bordered the lane,
      with thick undergrowth that seemed impenetrable to sight or movement. Over
      the tops of the bushes and between the trunks of the trees Armstrong
      gathered glimpses of a large mansion in the distance, extensive groups of
      chimneys being the most noticeable feature. Nearer was seen a carpet of
      green lawn, and beyond, the dappled glitter of the sunlight on a lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hold my horse?&rdquo; asked the youth, almost in a whisper. &ldquo;I must
      reconnoitre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang off his horse, and Armstrong grasped the rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they will not neigh,&rdquo; he said, as he disappeared into the
      undergrowth. It was evident the youth was well acquainted with his
      locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong sat silent, occasionally leaning over to stroke the neck of the
      steed he held in tether. He loved all animals, especially horses, and they
      reciprocated his affection. Suddenly the silence was shattered by a cry
      hoarse with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been watching your approach, perjured scoundrel! You shall not
      escape me this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir, I beseech you,&rdquo; came the entreating tones of Wentworth; &ldquo;I
      cannot bear arms against you. Listen but a moment, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw, you dog, or die the death of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I implore you; I cannot draw with you opposed. Sir, let me say a
      word&mdash;&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one clash of steel, then a brief cry of pain, and now silence
      again, all so quickly accomplished that first word and last were uttered
      in the time during which Armstrong leaped from saddle to earth. He
      searched hurriedly for the leafy tunnel through which Wentworth had
      passed, but before he found it the lad staggered into sight again, his
      left hand grasping his breast, his right dragging the sword, his face pale
      as chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has killed me,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. You would not now be on your feet if the wound were mortal. Who
      is your assailant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that. Help me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall first give the rogue a taste of his own surgery,&rdquo; cried
      Armstrong, drawing his blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other restrained his ardour, leaning heavily upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is her father. Do not leave me; I faint. If&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;if I&mdash;&mdash;I
      cannot direct you, take me down the lane; the high road. My home&mdash;&mdash;the
      house to the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim collapsed in a heap on the sward, reddening the grass with his
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong was no stranger to the rough art of the leech. He undid the
      doublet and flung it open; tore away the waistcoat and shirt, disclosing
      an ebbing gash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well pierced,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;An inch to the right would have done the
      job. The poor chap parried, but not enough; the onslaught was too fierce
      and sudden. The old man&rsquo;s intention was good, but the deflexion marred the
      thrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staunched the wound with the torn shirt, and tied a sash tightly round
      the body. Taking a leathern flask from his pouch, he forced some fluid
      between the grey lips, and Wentworth, with a long sigh, opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to boast of,&rdquo; said Armstrong carelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden twenty
      miles worse mangled. Can you sit your horse if I put you on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh God! oh God!&rdquo; moaned the youth, near to weeping. &ldquo;Fool that I was to
      risk all for the chance of a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, there&rsquo;s no risk. You&rsquo;ll be right as Edinburgh in three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks. Oh, my God! Would he had killed me outright!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is troubling you? Anything in which I can help? I see you are no
      coward, and it is not alone the wound that hurts. Is it this Oxford
      journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prone invalid made no reply, but, groaning, turned his face to the
      turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harken!&rdquo; cried Armstrong earnestly. &ldquo;Although our acquaintance is of the
      shortest, I would dearly love to do you a service. I will go to Oxford for
      you, and do there whatever you wish done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker reddened as he said this, and his conscience reproved him for
      thus making use of the other&rsquo;s infirmity, although he maintained stoutly
      to himself that he was honest in his proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stricken youth was no less troubled in mind than in body, feeling
      himself a treacherous wretch, accidentally well punished; but he, too,
      inwardly braced his weakening purpose by the thought that he acted for the
      good of his country, an action tending toward the speedy return of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me to my horse,&rdquo; he pleaded, ignoring the proffer just made to him.
      &ldquo;I must get home and learn whether this hurt is serious or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is far from serious, I tell you, and it means only a month&rsquo;s idleness.
      Lean you on me. There; make no exertion. I will lift you to your saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The powerful Scot raised him as if he were a child, and, with a woman&rsquo;s
      tenderness, set him gently on his horse. He got into his own seat so
      promptly that his steadying hand was on his comrade&rsquo;s shoulder before the
      swaying body could do more than threaten a fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wentworth nodded wearily, and the two set out slowly for the high road.
      Despite their awkward going, the edifice they sought was soon in sight,
      situated in a park, to which a winding lane led from the main
      thoroughfare. The place seemed deserted, and as they neared it Wentworth
      showed a faint anxiety that he might reach his room unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister must be told, of course, and a doctor brought; but I wish to
      avoid a rabble of gossiping servants if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will carry you wherever you direct, and if we meet anyone we must
      enjoin silence. Can you indicate the position of a private door through
      which we may enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most private door is the most public door. The front entrance will
      likely be deserted. I would walk, but that we must hurry or be seen. Take
      me up the stair and to the second room on your right. That is always ready
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Scot took the youth again in his arms and speedily laid him on his own
      bed. The jolting, despite the care taken, had shifted the rude bandaging,
      and the wound bled afresh. Armstrong, anxious for the safety of his
      burden, had not noticed that his own doublet was smeared with blood. With
      the better appliances now at hand, he did what was immediately necessary,
      and revived the lad&rsquo;s ebbing strength with a second draught from the
      leathern bottle. A sound of singing came to them as he finished his
      ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Frances&mdash;&mdash;my sister,&rdquo; breathed Wentworth with closed
      eyes. &ldquo;Break it gently to her, and say I am not dangerously hurt. She will
      know what to do.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;DETERMINATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>rmstrong stepped
      out into the hall, closing the door softly behind him. The melody was
      coming from the broad stairway, and ceased as the singer seemed to pause
      on the landing. He remembered that landing as he came up with his burden.
      Its whole length was lit by a row of mullioned windows, and one of these,
      being open, gave a view upon the green lawn in front of the house. He
      stood hesitating, undecided whether to advance as far as the head of the
      stair or await the coming of the girl where he was. Then he heard her
      voice evidently calling through the open window: &ldquo;John, there are two
      saddled horses under the trees. See who has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong strode forward to the stairhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, madam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of the horses is mine; the other
      belongs to your brother. May I ask the man to look after them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned quickly, her dark eyes wide with alarm. Into the mind of
      the intruder, looking down upon her from his elevation, flashed the words
      of her brother,&mdash;&ldquo;It simply means you have not yet met the right
      woman. When you meet her, you will be in as great a daze as that in which
      I found you at the cross-roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is magnificent,&rdquo; he said to himself. With her mass of black hair
      falling in wavy cascade over her shoulders, her midnight eyes appealing
      and dashed with a fear that swept the colour from her cheeks, she looked a
      pallid goddess standing against the pictured panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; she cried at last. &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; Then, noticing the blood
      on Armstrong&rsquo;s coat, she gave utterance to a startled exclamation, moving
      a step forward and checking herself. &ldquo;Is he wounded? Has there been a
      battle? Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is wounded, but not seriously. I brought him to his own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word she sprang up the stair, past her interlocutor, and
      flew along the hall, disappearing into the invalid&rsquo;s chamber. Armstrong
      thought it best not to intrude at the moment of their meeting, so passed
      on down the stair and out to the horses, where he found an old servitor
      standing guard over them, apparently at a loss what to do or how to
      account for their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you John?&rdquo; asked the Scot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, zur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the doctor that attends on this family when any of them are ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;E be Doctor Marsden, zur, down t&rsquo; th&rsquo; village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far away is the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout dhree mile, zur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Get on that horse, which belongs to your master, ride to the
      village, and bring Doctor Marsden here as quickly as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be Marster Tom ill, zur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is; but mind you say nothing to any one about it. Away with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong led his own horse to a stall in the stables, took off saddle and
      bridle, then went to the well and removed the stains from his clothing as
      well as water would do it. Going toward the house he met the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother says you tell him the wound is not dangerous. Is that true?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. I&rsquo;ve had a dozen worse myself,&rdquo; he replied, with encouraging
      exaggeration. &ldquo;But he will have to lie still for a month or more under
      your care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that is impossible, but I told him he shall do as the doctor
      orders, duty or no duty. I am going to send for Doctor Marsden, so pray
      pardon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already sent for Doctor Marsden. I took that liberty, for it is
      better in such a case to lose no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned and walked to the house with him. He found the patient
      restless and irritable. The wan whiteness of his face had given place to
      rising fever. His eyes were unnaturally bright, and they followed
      Armstrong with a haunted look in them. His visitor said nothing, but
      wished the doctor would make haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Doctor Marsden arrived he went about his work in businesslike
      fashion. A physician of that day had ample experience with either gunshot
      or sword wounds, each being plentiful enough to arouse little curiosity
      respecting their origin. He brusquely turned Armstrong and the sister out
      of the room, after having requisitioned what materials he needed, and the
      two stood together in anxious and somewhat embarrassed silence on the
      landing, within call if either were needed. The girl was the first to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear my brother&rsquo;s case is more dangerous than you would have me
      suppose,&rdquo; she said in tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from the wound,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what, then?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. He has something on his mind. I saw that from the moment
      he was hurt. He is very brave, and this accident of itself would make
      little impression on him. My acquaintance with him is but a few hours old,
      yet I know he is a fearless youth. Are you aware of a mission that takes
      him to Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the least knowledge of it. I heard no hint of his going, and
      he said nothing of his journey when we spoke together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me he had expected a comrade who had failed him. Cromwell himself
      gave him a pass for two. He said he was to see the brother of his
      sweetheart, who is with the King in Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very likely. The two were great friends always, even when they
      took opposite sides in this deplorable contest which is rending our
      distracted country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be more than friendship in this journey, otherwise Cromwell
      would not have given him such a pass as he holds. Then for an unknown,
      un-vouched-for man to enter Oxford at this moment is highly perilous, an
      action not to be undertaken lightly. If he go in disguise, and such a pass
      be found on him, not all Cromwell&rsquo;s army could save him. It may be he is
      commissioned to treat for peace, but that is unlikely. Such proposals
      should come from the defeated force. Depend upon it, something important
      hangs on this Oxford excursion, and if anything can be done to relieve his
      mind regarding it, this will do more toward his speedy recovery than all
      the leech&rsquo;s phlebotomy. If I can render service to him in Oxford, I shall
      be glad to undertake his commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, then, go to Oxford?&rdquo; asked the girl innocently, turning her
      disquiet and disquieting eyes full upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;I had no such intention when I set out,&rdquo; stammered
      Armstrong, abashed that for once his natural caution had forsaken him. &ldquo;It
      matters little how far south I go, and I am willing to do an errand for a
      friend. I took him for a Royalist at first, and so saw no danger in his
      purpose, but if he be a Parliamentarian, then Oxford is a place to avoid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not tell you he was a Parliamentarian?&rdquo; questioned the girl, now
      alarmed in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? You must be mistaken, sir; I gave you no information about my
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said his friend in the King&rsquo;s forces had not thought the less of him
      because he took the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am distraught with anxiety about him, and gave but little heed to my
      words. I would have you remember only what my brother himself told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need have no fear, madam. Anything said by either of you will never
      be used to your hurt. I am a Scot, and have nothing to do with English
      strife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their conversation was interrupted by the opening of the door and the
      reappearance of the doctor. The girl could not conceal her trepidation,
      for the nontechnical stranger&rsquo;s assurances had slight weight with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas is doing very well; very well indeed,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;You have
      no cause for alarm, not the slightest, if he can but be kept quiet for
      some days, and rest where he is for a few weeks. You attended to him, sir,
      and I take it that you possess a smattering of our art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have need of that knowledge, Doctor,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, &ldquo;for those who
      have done me the honour to run me through rarely had the consideration to
      make their attack within easy call of a surgeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Royal; or Parliament, sir? One likes to know before opening one&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, Doctor, I&rsquo;m a Scotsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that accounts for it.&rdquo; Then, turning to the girl, he said, &ldquo;Your
      brother wishes to speak with you, and I have reluctantly given my consent.
      You will stay with him as short a time as may be, and I will be here to
      see that you do not overstep a reasonable limit. One word more. Do not
      argue with him, or dispute anything he says, no matter how absurd it may
      seem. Agree to any proposal he makes, even if you know it cannot be
      carried out. He is evidently disturbed about his duty. Soothe him, soothe
      him and concur. There is little use in telling a lad in his condition that
      duty must wait till wounds are healed, but he will recognize that fact
      when he is well again. Meanwhile humour him, humour him. Away, and I&rsquo;ll
      count the minutes till you are out again. I will find John and send him
      for a competent nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances opened the door gently and met her brother&rsquo;s hungry eyes. She sat
      down beside him, taking his fevered hand between her cool palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a doomed man; a doomed man!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Tom; the doctor quite agrees with the stranger that your wound
      is not dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of the wound; that does not matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does, then, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, this morning at daylight I was to have been taken out and shot.&rdquo;
       The girl&rsquo;s hands tightened on his. &ldquo;Cromwell himself reprieved me last
      night, but on conditions. The sentence still hangs over me, and now I&rsquo;m
      helpless to avert it, and all through my own folly. Oh, I have been a
      heedless fool! With every incentive not to take risk, I have walked
      blindly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, yes; but tell me how I can aid you. The stranger says he will
      do anything you want done in Oxford, going there specially on your errand,
      and he looks like a man to be trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad drew away his hand, turned his face to the wall, and groaned
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you trust him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust him!&rdquo; he cried impatiently, &ldquo;Frances, Frances, it is against him I
      am going to Oxford! The man is a spy carrying a message to the King. He is
      interfering in a quarrel that should be no concern of his, and his life is
      already forfeit, as indeed is the case with my own. But the price of my
      life is the thwarting of him. The King will give him a commission to be
      taken to the Scottish nobles. It is that document I was to rend from him,
      by force if necessary, by cunning if possible. I was to give him every aid
      to reach Oxford, but on the way back I was to gain possession of this
      commission and ride to Cromwell with it; then life and promotion were
      mine, and now I lie here helpless as a trussed fowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A loathesome, treacherous task for a man to put upon the shoulders of a
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look you, Frances, &rsquo;tis but meeting treachery with treachery.
      Armstrong has no right in this contest, and his success means a new blaze
      of war with the loss of thousands of innocent lives. It means the possible
      triumph of the King who murdered our father and broke his pledged word to
      him and to you. And seeming trickery may be real mercy, as in this case it
      is, for if Cromwell cannot obtain the King&rsquo;s letter by stealthy means he
      will crush this Armstrong as ruthlessly as he would crush a gnat. By no
      possibility can this Scot ever see his land again if he holds that fatal
      instrument, for the whole army is watching him. But once bereft of it, he
      is free to go as he pleases. The simpleton thinks he has deluded Cromwell,
      and is blundering on through a fool&rsquo;s paradise that bristles with unseen
      swords. If I were his dearest friend I could do him no greater service
      than to purloin the document of doom he will carry when he turns his face
      north again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; asked the girl in a low voice, her eyes
      staring into space, her hand trembling with apprehension at what she knew
      intuitively was to be required of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, dear, you once took a journey alone to London, to see our
      father. Again you went the same road, to aid him if you could, and failed,
      to our lasting grief, through the supineness of a thrice-perjured monarch.
      Will you refuse to set out on a shorter expedition, not for my sake only,
      although the saving of my worthless life will be one effect of your
      success, but to overturn what is perhaps the final plot of our father&rsquo;s
      slayer, who has already deluged the land with blood. Will you not help to
      bring more speedily that peace the kingdom yearns for, and the only peace
      now possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she said quietly, rising, stooping over, and kissing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clung to her hand with the tenacity of the weak and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, &ldquo;remember you are protected by Cromwell&rsquo;s
      own pass, so have no fear. In case of need the army or any part of it must
      stand ready to aid you if you call upon it. Old John will ride behind and
      look after you. Although the pass mentions two only, it is so sweeping
      that they will doubtless take it to include a servant. Any subordinate
      will hesitate before he delays one carrying so broad a permit from
      Cromwell himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I shall meet with no difficulty, you may be sure. You have
      already talked too much, and the doctor will censure me. Good-bye, Tom.
      Get speedily well, and that will be my reward, for I swear to you, by our
      father&rsquo;s memory, that my hand shall give into Cromwell&rsquo;s the King&rsquo;s
      parchment.&rdquo; Kissing him again she tore herself away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Armstrong to me,&rdquo; were his parting words to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong entered the room shortly after Frances had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; cried the Scot cheerily. &ldquo;The doctor is in despair
      over the time your sister spent with you, and he is at this moment chiding
      her. Me he has threatened with direst penalties if I exceed a scant
      minute. So I shall just have to bid you farewell and be off, wishing you
      quick recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armstrong,&rdquo; said the boy huskily. &ldquo;My sister must take to the Oxford road
      and remedy my default. Will you be her comrade there and back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As faithfully as ever belted knight attended fair lady,&rdquo; replied
      Armstrong, his eyes suddenly ablaze with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John will attend her, and I am sure your good sword will protect her if
      need be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take oath on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you the pass which is safe-conduct for you both, and I think it
      will serve to cover John as well. If not, your own might shield him as far
      as Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own will shield me as far as Manchester, and this will, more
      appropriately, convey your sister and her servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! That of course, as it should be. My head is spinning, and my
      thoughts are astray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After Manchester we will manage some way. Be not uneasy about that. I
      give you the word of a Scottish gentleman I will care for your sister as
      if she were my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong took the pass, which was now ominously stained red. He grasped
      his supposed friend by the hand, bade him farewell, and wished him quick
      healing. Wentworth&rsquo;s throat choked, for a feeling of strong liking for the
      man almost overpowered him, but a stinging sense of his own perfidiousness
      held him silent. Remorse was already biting worse than the wound in his
      side. The stranger turned for a moment at the door, waved his hand, and
      called to him to be of good cheer. A sob broke from the lad&rsquo;s throat, and
      weakly he cursed the exigiencies of war.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Armstrong left
      the room where the wounded boy lay he found Doctor Marsden alone, pacing
      up and down the long hall, visibly impatient. However, he appeared
      gratified that the stranger had contented himself with so short an
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Scot, &ldquo;I have soothed his mind as successfully as you
      administered to his body. I undertook the duty which troubles him, and now
      he has nothing to do but get well, which I am sure will be the speedier
      that he is in your skilful care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very complimentary, sir, and I thank you. If you succeeded in
      putting his mind at ease you have taken a great weight from mine, for I
      like to treat corporal wounds uncomplicated by mental worry. I am
      expecting the nurse every moment and will just step inside until she
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong bade the practitioner farewell, and this proved the last he was
      to see of him. The young man went to the stables to feed and water Bruce,
      not knowing how soon he might have need of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horse and man were glad to greet each other. Armstrong examined the animal
      with care, and was pleased to note that he was none the worse for his long
      and toilsome journey of the day before. The Scot found himself wondering
      into what part of the the land he had got. Cumberland he knew, and
      Northumberland very thoroughly, but this district was strange to him. As a
      rule he was able to estimate with some exactitude the distance a horse
      travelled in a day, but the journey with Captain Bent had been over a
      rough country, in continually changing directions that had ended in
      bewildering him. High passes had been crossed, and deep valleys traversed
      with a speed that said much for the mobility of the&rsquo; Parliamentary
      troopers. They had avoided villages, keeping through barren lands,
      uninhabited for the most part, until they reached the fertile and
      cultivated region in whose outskirts was situated the estate of Corbiton
      Manor. The questions he asked of his captors had invariably gone
      unanswered, either because the men were silent from nature or from
      command, or because they knew as little of the road as he did. The trend
      of the present morning&rsquo;s journey had been southeast, the country becoming
      more and more populous as he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the house, he met Frances Wentworth evidently in search of
      him. It seemed to him she had been weeping, and there was a perceptible
      change in the cordiality of her manner toward him. He feared this was
      perhaps to be accounted for by the admiration of her beauty which his
      glances might have betrayed, and he resolved to be more careful in future,
      although it was difficult to repress the exaltation he felt at the
      prospect of being her companion on a long and possibly dangerous
      expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my brother spoken to you of my visit to Oxford?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in great haste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be as convenient to you to set out tomorrow morning as this
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. It would be better, in fact, for my horse had a hard day of it
      yesterday, travelling I don&rsquo;t know how many miles. Perhaps you can tell me
      where I am. I could get no information from my surly gaolers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in the southern part of Durham, near the Yorkshire border.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come even farther than I thought. A day&rsquo;s rest will do no harm to
      the horse, for he little knows what is before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed at a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said at last, somewhat primly, as she turned away.
      Then, pausing and hesitating a moment, she continued with face half
      averted, &ldquo;My brother and I are twins and perhaps the more devoted to each
      other on that account. I would do anything for him. I wish to stay and see
      the nurse installed. There are many things to think of at such an
      unexpected crisis, and no one to think of them but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thoroughly understand the situation, and I wish I were able to tell you
      how completely I sympathize with you. Although I know your brother so
      short a time, I am only too glad to be of the slightest assistance to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gracious avowal did not appear to have the effect it merited. Some
      trace of a frown marred the smoothness of the girl&rsquo;s brow, and her lips
      became compressed. If a stranger is to be robbed and thwarted, it is
      embarrassing to hear friendly protestations from him, especially when
      there is no doubt about their truth. This man was evidently the soul of
      honest candour, and the repulsion which had sickened the girl&rsquo;s mind at
      the revolting task fate had assigned to her was increased by the
      genuineness of his good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she murmured again, and left him abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very early next morning when Armstrong stood by his black horse in
      the lane under the trees, waiting for his fair charge, who seemed to
      exercise the privilege of her sex in being late. Old John was already
      mounted on an animal that, besides carrying him, was pack-horse for the
      luggage required by the young lady on her travels. When the girl appeared,
      Armstrong stepped forward to offer his assistance; but he was a fraction
      of a second too late, for, ignoring him, she was in her saddle and away
      before he could utter a word. He admired the light ease with which she
      accomplished this act, and saw at once she was a practical horsewoman on
      as good terms with her steed as he was with his own. She rode down the
      lane to the main road, then turned south, never looking again toward the
      home she was leaving; hurrying, indeed, as if it were her purpose to get
      out of sight as soon as possible. The undulating nature of the country
      soon concealed Warburton Park mansion, and the trio rode on steadily, the
      girl in front, Armstrong following close, and Old John lagging somewhere
      in the rear, as if he knew that, after all, his heavily laden nag must set
      the pace, however briskly the more metalled cattle ahead of him started
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour of this Armstrong began to wonder where he was going.
      Nothing had been said to him regarding the route to be taken, and the girl
      went on as confidently, never turning her head, as if she and not he were
      to be the leader of the expedition. He laughed quietly at this, then,
      gathering rein, Bruce, requiring no other hint, stepped out and overtook
      the horse in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any plan marked out with reference to the roads we may take, or
      the towns we are to pass through or avoid?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We will reach York to-night, then follow the London road as far as
      Stamford. After that we branch southwest through Northampton to Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all settled then,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the way well, and you told me you were a stranger. I have passed
      between York and London four times,&rdquo; she answered seriously, and with a
      chilling tone of finality which seemed to indicate that further discussion
      was unnecessary. The inflexion may have been too subtle to impress itself
      upon the young man, for he continued with obvious geniality,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      have wandered far afield for one so young.&rdquo; To this remark the girl made
      no reply. Her eyes were fixed on the road ahead, and Armstrong, being at a
      loss to continue a one-sided conversation, found nothing further to say.
      He was vaguely conscious of the constraint that had come between them, for
      she had talked with him freely enough the day before; but he could not
      account for the change. He had always been accustomed to the free-spoken
      communion of men, and knew little of the vagaries of the other sex, whom
      he had ever regarded as the more talkative. He feared he had offended her
      by some thoughtless observation, and racked his brain trying to remember
      what it might have been. If it were her brother who rode beside him he
      would have asked him plainly where the offence lay, and would have fought
      him joyfully if the answer was not to his mind; but he was afraid of this
      dainty lady and anxious not to displease her. He began to see that he ran
      risk of disappointment in his anticipation of pleasure through a
      companionship which the other party plainly regarded as enforced and not
      at all to her liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They approached a declivity which disclosed a small hamlet at the foot of
      which flowed a stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name of this river?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is the Tees,&rdquo; she
      answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that will be Yorkshire beyond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he could think of nothing further to say, and inwardly chafed at his
      own awkwardness. He sympathized deeply with his companion, compelled to
      leave her only brother lying helpless from a serious wound, and thought
      her taciturnity arose from brooding on his peril, which in part it did. He
      wished he could call to his tongue some consolatory phrase, but his
      usually ready wit seemed to have deserted him. Yet he thought it
      impossible that they should journey thus gloomily the length of the land.
      Perhaps to-morrow would prove an amendment on to-day. And so through
      Yorkshire the silent progress continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was better than that to the north of the Tees, and also less
      deserted. They passed long trains of pack-horses travelling toward York,
      and occasionally met an equestrian, sometimes alone, but more often
      attended by one or more servants. So far they had seen nothing to show
      that civil war cursed the country, and no soldier had stepped forward to
      question their purpose in being abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not unlike some parts of Scotland,&rdquo; he said at last, in an
      ill-fated attempt to revive a conversation which he did not recognize as
      dead and beyond his power to resuscitate. The girl reined in her horse,
      and Bruce stopped through sympathy, old John halting, that the respectful
      distance he kept might not be decreased. Frances held her head high, and
      there was a sparkle of determination in her eye. It was best to begin
      right, and she would put this persistent man in his place, a task already
      too long delayed. And perhaps the putting of him in his place would lessen
      the clamour of her own conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, who are you?&rdquo; was her amazing inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; gasped Armstrong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Scotsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said, what are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m a drover&mdash;a dealer in cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my brother tell you who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me his father was the late Earl of Strafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday I was grateful to you for the aid you afforded my brother, as I
      should have been grateful to my servant if he had occupied your place; but
      I should not have forgotten the distance between that servant and myself.
      Strafford&rsquo;s daughter does not recognize a drover as her social equal. I
      ask you to take the position I set for you when I began this journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong&rsquo;s face became very red, and then all colour left it as this
      pronouncement went on. His back stiffened, and, although he spoke with
      measured calmness, there was a thrill of cold anger in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, madam, that I am to ride with your servant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objection in the least. From the conversations we had together
      he shows himself a man of knowledge and a lover of horses, which is an
      easy passport to my liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad his company is so much to your taste, and I shall be obliged to
      you if you fall back with him, as I wish to ride alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I not do under command; for, although I may cherish old John&rsquo;s
      conversation, I cannot admit the claim of superiority you set up. I am a
      drover, I said, and so your ancient King Alfred might with equal truth
      have dubbed himself a baker, if old tales are true. I am William Armstrong
      of Gilnochie Towers, Lord of the Lands of Langholm, Dalbetht,
      Stapil-Gortown, Shield, and Dalblane. I can trace my lineage as far back
      as any noble in England, and come to my ancestral thieves as soon as they.
      In courtesy we Armstrongs are the equals of any Englander, and in battle
      we have never turned our backs on them. The castles of my clan line the
      river Liddel, and when I ride with my friend, the Earl of Traquair, I ride
      by his side and not with his followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you overwhelm me with your grandeur,&rdquo; said the girl loftily,
      rejoiced to find herself in what promised to be a quarrel. She was human,
      and thought it would prove easier to rob an enemy than a friend. &ldquo;I
      thought the crowns of England and Scotland were united, but I see I was
      mistaken. I travel with the king of Scotland, and he is doubtless on his
      way to Oxford to confer with his brother the king of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I go to greet his Majesty, Charles, and if he dare to address me
      as you have done I will tell him I am more king of the Border than he is
      king of England, and my saying will be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances Wentworth bowed low in mock humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Highness of the Border, will you permit me to ride in your train? I
      know I am not worthy, but I ask the boon that I may seek consolation in
      communion with my servitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you may ride where you please,&rdquo; gruffly replied the thoroughly
      angered Scot, tingling with wounded pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I thank you,&rdquo; replied the maiden, bowing again, &ldquo;and I am delighted
      that you should exhibit to one so lowly as I, an example of that courtesy
      of which you just now boasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the indignant man made no reply, thus changing his former
      relations as regarded conversation. He urged on his horse, and she, after
      pausing awhile and seeing that John would approach no nearer, also went
      on, and thus the three kept for the day their new relative positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the excitement of this verbal encounter had passed, the gratification
      at bringing about a rupture between them proved short-lived. Suddenly she
      was on the verge of tears, but strenuously repressed them, fearing he
      would look back, which he never did. That mood vanished, and hot anger
      replaced it, the more intense as she knew herself the aggressor.
      Nevertheless he had been boorish, she said to herself; almost brutal in
      his insolence. If he were a tithe of the gentleman he so blatantly
      proclaimed himself, he would have turned round and apologized for his
      rudeness, even if his anger at first had been justified. But there he rode
      in front of her, hand on hip and head held high, as if he were lord of the
      land. A beggarly Scot, proud and poor, from whose tongue flowed glibly a
      list of barren acres which civilized men would disdain to live upon, like
      the stunted lands to the north of her own home. Never turned his back
      indeed! If her father had been allowed a free hand, he would have chased
      all such braggarts home to their kennels. Even now, with his pretended
      independence, this Scot was travelling on his traitorous mission under the
      safe-conduct of the man he would betray. It was no treachery to outwit a
      spy, but a patriotic duty, and she would bid adieu to all qualms of
      conscience. And yet&mdash;and yet, he had told her brother he would treat
      her as his own sister, and it was they who had begged his convoy! Still,
      he may have eagerly seized the opportunity of the pass to get himself
      scathless to Oxford and back to Carlisle. Thus varying emotions surged
      through her heart, to be followed by anxious questionings and at last deep
      depression, during which her head hung and her dimmed eyes saw nothing of
      the road. Unheeded, the sun passed the meridian, and at last she was
      roused to a sense of her surroundings by the stopping of her unguided
      horse before a roadside inn. Armstrong, his black steed brought to a
      standstill across the highway, sat rigidly upright, and he said, when she
      thus unexpectedly looked at him with something of startled appeal in her
      eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;We stop here for rest and refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need neither rest nor refreshment,&rdquo; she answered wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of you, madam, but of the horses. They have already
      gone too far without food, but in this benighted land there has been no
      opportunity of baiting them till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you said it was like Scotland,&rdquo; she answered sharply, whipped to
      fresh anger again that she should have imagined he thought of her when he
      did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang lightly from her horse to the ground, and, without a look at
      the faithful animal that had carried her so far, walked very straight to
      the door of the hostelry and disappeared within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time of waiting had ticked itself out on the old clock of the
      inn, Armstrong ordered the horses on the road again, and sent old John to
      warn his mistress that the way was still long to York. She came out
      promptly, mounting proudly without a word, and the expedition set forth as
      before, old John contentedly bringing up the rear. All afternoon they made
      their progress along the very direct road, no utterance from any one of
      the three. Frances grew more and more tired of this doleful journey, so
      woefully begun, placing the blame on her own weary shoulders for the most
      part, but now and then filled with a growing hatred of the stolid figure
      in front, who never once turned round; never once slackened the pace;
      never once made inquiry of any kind. What brutes men were, after all! The
      horses they bestrode were the better animals!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the nearly level rays of the evening sun glorified the towers of
      the grey minster, transforming them for the moment into piles of rosy
      marble, and the walled town was spread out before them. They came to
      Bootham Bar, and here, for the first time, a man-at-arms questioned their
      right of way. Armstrong silently presented to him the blood-stained pass,
      bearing the signature of the Man of Iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he on the pack-horse of your company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man-at-arms stood aside, and the trio went up the clattering street
      until they came to a house of entertainment once called &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo;
       with a picture of Charles on the swaying sign, now slightly changed to
      represent Fairfax, a good Yorkshireman, while the lettering had been
      obliterated and &ldquo;The Fairfax Arms&rdquo; painted over it. The leader of the
      expedition ordered the best apartment in the house for the lady, and sat
      where he was while the bustling landlord assisted the fatigued traveller
      to dismount. Armstrong and old John saw to the disposal of the horses,
      then the young man walked to the minster and round it, noticing everywhere
      the ravages of the late siege. The town had not yet recovered its arrested
      prosperity, and most of the people he met were heavy-footed soldiers and
      citizens in sombre dress. York had been Royalist to the core, and now
      calamity seemed to brood over it. Armstrong made his way to a mercer&rsquo;s
      shop in the main street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My garments,&rdquo; he said to the obsequious proprietor, &ldquo;are somewhat
      stained, and I would renew them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many changing their coats nowadays,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and we
      must even cut them of the cloth most popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whipped out a measuring-tape and deftly took the dimensions of his
      customer, muttering the numbers as he stretched his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time to spare for the making of a costume, but must content
      myself with what lies on your shelves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I took you for a traveller, and am but estimating what will best
      become you. Your inches are just on the large side, sir, but I shall
      pleasure you, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spread out on the long table some apparel in dejected brown, which, as
      it seemed to Armstrong, was but clumsily cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would garb me as a shepherd, I see. I come from the North, where we
      are not tailor&rsquo;s models, perhaps, but we scorn such duds as you exhibit.
      Cannot you furnish me with something more like what I wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mercer looked at him, hesitating for a moment, then led the way to an
      inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can show you goods there is little call for, and if you are satisfied
      with them you take them at your own price and risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and brought out from their concealment rich garments of
      the Cavalier fashion, which he handled gingerly, as if afraid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s more like. Now I shall set myself out from top to toe in
      something suitable for riding. My horse and I are two sections of the same
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the privacy of the back room the change was effected, and presently
      William Armstrong stood as gay and comely a man as could be found in all
      England, superbly attired, with filmy lace fluttering at neck and wrists.
      The mercer hovered before him, rubbing one hand over the other, with an
      artist&rsquo;s appreciation of the result his efforts had produced, and indeed
      something more glimmering behind in the depths of his appraising eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make many a heart beat faster if you pass through the streets of
      York in that fashion,&rdquo; said the mercer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it. I was never one to be popular with the lasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of women, sir, but of men who have fought and lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all&rsquo;s not lost because York is taken! There will be a King in England
      for many a day yet, never you fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mercer cast a timorous glance about him, then suddenly thrust forth
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brave man. God make your prophecy true. I thought you came in
      to change your coat with the times, like the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coats matter little if the heart is right,&rdquo; replied the Northerner,
      returning the proffered clasp. &ldquo;You will do what you like with this
      discarded shell of mine, for I travel light and cannot be bothered with
      it. So, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ca cannie,&rsquo; as your countrymen say, when once you reach the street.
      Avoid the soldiery and get free of York as soon as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gloom of evening was on the town when Armstrong emerged, yet he had
      not gone twenty steps before a stern officer planted himself square in his
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; came the curt demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend who has been looking for you. The shops are closing, and I am
      purposing to buy a pair of pistols like the one whose butt I can see in
      your belt. I may need your help to open a gunner&rsquo;s booth for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is need of that when it grows dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow, you shall come with me and explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. You shall come with me and do my explaining. And as the day is
      fading, read that while it still holds.&rdquo; Armstrong handed him the pass and
      the officer scanned it suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Oxford,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;If you are not on the road between Carlisle and
      Oxford, you are at least in the costume for the latter sink of iniquity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I have the pass to bring me there. Do you dispute it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that, for you would come into collision with Oliver Cromwell
      if you did. Now give me your aid toward firearms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer turned with him and walked down the street, beat at the door
      of the gunshop, and saw the desires of the stranger fulfilled. Then he
      accompanied him to the door of the inn, bidding him good-night, and
      disappearing down the unlighted street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady was partaking of the repast prepared for her in the private
      parlour set aside for her use, said the landlord in answer to his guest&rsquo;s
      inquiry. On being shown to the door Armstrong knocked on the panels, and
      was admitted by old John, who was in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sat at a table and looked up with surprise, not recognizing her
      visitor in his new finery, thinking some stranger had mistaken the room;
      but, seeing who it was as he advanced, she turned her gaze away from him
      and gave no greeting. If he came to apologize now, it was too late, she
      said to herself, and his first words showed that this was indeed his
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said with a courtly inclination of his head, which obeisance,
      it flashed across the girl&rsquo;s mind, had been purchased with his fresh
      accoutering, a thought that almost brought a smile to her lips, which she
      hoped to keep firm. &ldquo;Madam, I crave your pardon for my unseemliness of
      temper to-day. I am at best an uncouth person, travelling at the head of
      my own men, who question neither words nor acts of mine, and so have led
      me into the gruff habit of expecting obedience and not censure. I am no
      squire of dames, as there is little need to tell you, for already you know
      it from this day&rsquo;s experience of my ways; but I am deeply grieved that I
      fell so far short of the courtesy which is your due, and I trust you will
      forgive my lapse of manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was an apology indeed, that might well have called forth a generous
      response, and undoubtedly would have done so from a woman of the world;
      but Frances had been too sorely hurt by his long incivility toward her.
      Ladies in the romances she had read were always treated with the utmost
      chivalry, and, if truth must be told, she was tired and cross, so she
      hardened her heart, bent her proud eyes on the latticed window before her,
      and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a few moments&rsquo; silence in the room; then her punishment came in
      his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped we might part good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part!&rdquo; she cried in sharp terror, and those wide black eyes of hers
      quickly deserted the blank panes to fall upon him. She had never
      anticipated such an outcome of their quarrel as this, nor dreamed that it
      was easily possible for him to circumvent all her plans by withdrawing
      himself from her company. Instantly the dread consequences of such a
      determination on his part&mdash;and she had had a glimpse of his
      resoluteness&mdash;loomed up before her, every little disagreement between
      them sinking into nothingness before this fearful alternative. She dared
      not lose sight of him until her mission was accomplished, or her brother&rsquo;s
      life and her country&rsquo;s ruin paid the penalty of her foolishness. She must
      cast herself at his feet, if necessary, to retain him, and here she had
      jeopardized everything in an outburst of temper. A chilling fear crept
      into her heart that any complacency she might show him would be too late.
      Secretly she had rather admired his sturdy independence and pride of race,
      comparing it with her own vacillating purpose, ready one moment to forgive
      and the next to ban; but now this lofty self-respect might prove her
      undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I overrated my power of serving you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I forgot
      for the moment how slight was my acquaintance with your family.
      Manchester, and not Oxford, is my destination, and I shall make for that
      town to-morrow before you are astir. The country is not nearly so
      disturbed as I expected to find it, and the roads are perfectly safe;
      indeed you know the route better than I. This pass is a most potent
      document and will open every gate. I leave it with you.&rdquo; He placed the
      paper on the table before her. &ldquo;If I might venture to counsel you, I
      should advise you not to take it into Oxford unless you have some
      satisfactory plea to account for its possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had anything to eat since you came into York?&rdquo; Her voice was as
      sweet as the note of a nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Armstrong with a laugh. &ldquo;I had forgotten about that; a most
      unusual trick of memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was too angry with you at the wayside inn, and I could not touch a
      morsel, so I thus came famished into York. John, see if Mr. Armstrong&rsquo;s
      meal is prepared, and ask them to serve it here. I think you Scottish
      people possess a proverb that it is unfair, or something like that, to
      speak with a hungry man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, many of our sayings pertain to eating. We are an uncouth folk, I
      fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you are far from uncouth to-night, Mr. Armstrong. I thought it was
      we ladies who hurried to the mercers when we came to town, but you lost no
      time in the delightful quest. That was why I was so deeply offended with
      you when you came in. You are most ungallant not to have invited me to go
      with you. I could not have visited shops alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no need to visit the shops. Nothing they sell could improve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so hopeless as that?&rdquo; said the girl, with the sigh of the
      accomplished coquette, leaning back in her chair and entrancing him with
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong blushed to the roots of his flaxen hair and stammered,&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;I
      meant you are perfect as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed merrily at his confusion, and her mirth came the heartier as
      she saw she was to accomplish her object; then the laugh was checked as a
      sudden wave of pity for him surged over her. For all his size he was a
      very boy in lack of guile, and a shiver ran over her as she pictured what
      he must think of her when he knew. The sudden tension was relieved by the
      arrival of old John and the servants carrying a meal hot and savoury,
      whose incense was a delight to the starving man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;sit down opposite me. Put this pass in safe keeping
      until I seek for it. You will surely not be so cruel as to desert me on
      the first stage of our journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the bewitched man, &ldquo;I shall do with eagerness whatever it is
      your pleasure to ask of me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;RECONCILIATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nother glorious
      summer morning greeted the pilgrims at York; a morning so clear and
      splendid that it seemed to have lifted the gloom which covered the
      captured city, as the sun might dissipate a veil of mist. In spite of her
      fatigue of the day before, Frances was the first afoot, and at this
      setting forth Armstrong and old John were the laggards, as she blithely
      informed them when they appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they rode away from the ancient town the girl could scarcely refrain
      from joining the larks in their matin song, such a strange feeling of
      elation filled her being. She had had her first intoxicating taste of
      power; the supreme power of a beautiful woman over a strong, determined
      man. He had come to her the night before with resolution stamped on his
      masterful face; came of set purpose, a course of action well marked out
      for himself in the long dreary ride to York, and he announced that purpose
      to her, catching her entirely unaware. She was without experience in the
      ways of men, knowing nothing of them save such enlightenment as a sister
      might gather from a brother, and this knowledge she saw instinctively
      would be of no service in the contest that so unexpectedly confronted her.
      As boy and girl the arguments with her brother had been of the
      rough-and-tumble order, where the best man won and the other sat down and
      cried. Armstrong had said in effect, &ldquo;I leave your company,&rdquo; and a glance
      at his face left no doubt but he meant it. What instinct of heredity had
      placed her potent weapons silently before her; what unsuspected latent
      spirit of coquetry had taught her on the instant how to use them? A
      melting glance of the eyes; a low, lingering tone of voice; and this
      stubborn man was as wax in her hands. She had shorn him of his fixed
      intention, as Delilah had shorn Sampson of his locks; and as this simile
      occurred to her the spectre of her mission rose before her, and she
      remembered with a shudder that the parallel of Delilah held true in more
      senses than one. She glanced sideways at her Samson riding so easily on
      his splendid horse. What a noble-looking youth he was, and how well his
      new attire became him. Not any of the courtiers she had seen in the gay
      entourage of Charles in London could be compared with him. And what an
      ill-flavoured task was hers: to baffle him; to humiliate and defeat him;
      to send him crestfallen and undone to his own land! Delilah indeed! &ldquo;The
      Philistines be upon thee, Samson!&rdquo; Poor Samson! She had always been sorry
      for him, as she read, and now&mdash;now&mdash;hers was the role to wreck
      him! Again she glanced at him, and thus caught his gaze bent upon her. He
      smiled at her; was smiling when she turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can read your thoughts in your face,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; she asked in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. At first the pure sweet beauty of the morning appealed to you. You
      were glad to leave the shut-in streets of the town and be once more in the
      fresh open country. The song of the birds charmed you, and had there been
      no listeners your voice would have joined theirs. When first I saw you,
      you were singing, and that was the morning of the day before yesterday;
      yet it seems ages past, and I have known you all my life. It was my
      ill-omened fate to break upon you with evil tidings, and a remembrance of
      my news disturbed you a moment since. The thought of your brother came to
      you, and the sunshine of your face died out in sorrow for him, wishing you
      had news of him. Do not be concerned for him. I have seen many a wound
      deeper than his, and they were of small account with youth and health to
      contend against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed and turned her face away, making no comment upon his
      conjectures, which were so far astray from accuracy. Why had she given no
      thought to her brother, whose welfare had never before been absent from
      her mind, yet who never before was in such danger as now? Why had a
      stranger&rsquo;s image come between them, so monopolizing her mental vision that
      all her pity had been for him? Delilah was the stronger woman, with no
      qualms of conscience to unnerve her steady hand. She remembered her kin
      and wasted no thought on the stranger who fell in love with her in the
      valley of Sorek. &ldquo;And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,
      she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines saying, &lsquo;Come up this
      once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.&rsquo; Then the lords of the
      Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.&rdquo; Money in
      their hand! The price of a trusting man! Was there anything so baleful as
      that in all Scripture? When she presented Cromwell with the locks of
      Samson she would quote that sinister verse to him. Well this lord of the
      Philistines knew that her brother was not guilty of the treason for which
      he had been condemned. Cromwell came, not with money in his hand, but with
      life to be given or withheld, as foul play was successfully accomplished
      or the reverse. A helpless rage at the part assigned to her filled her
      heart with bitterness, and her eyes with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what valley this is we are descending?&rdquo; said Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The valley of Sorek,&rdquo; said her lips before her reason could check them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the young man, amazed, although the reply gave him no hint
      of its inner meaning. Then he saw that some strong emotion had overpowered
      her, against which all her struggles were in vain. Instant sympathy with
      her sorrow manifested itself in his action. He brought his horse close
      beside her, reached out and touched her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart, do not grieve,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;I pledge my faith your
      brother is better already. Would I had thought of it in time, and there
      might have been a horseman travelling all night to York, bringing you
      later tidings of him; but I am ever behindhand with my purposing, and
      remember a project when it is too late to put it into action. Many a fight
      that same backhandedness has led me into. I am for ever trusting the wrong
      man and laying myself open to his craft, yet am I hail-well-met with the
      next, learning no lesson from experience. Talking of this thrust your
      brother got, I remember well, two years ago, when three men who bore me no
      good will came to me and said the Earl of Traquair had bade them make
      peace with me. I was very willing and struck hands with them. So off we
      set together, at their behest, to Traquair&rsquo;s Castle, that we might ratify
      our compact, for the Earl was a good friend of mine. We had gone near on
      five miles, and were chatting pleasantly together, when in the twinkling
      of an eye the three set on me. Three to one is no odds for an active man
      to grumble at if he can face them and has a rock or a tree at his back,
      but we were on the open plain, and I had a blade in my ribs before I could
      put hand to hilt. I drove Bruce at the first assailant and, ran him
      through as he went down. Then I cut for it till the followers were
      separated; so I turned on the one nearest me, gave him his dose, and
      chased the third man until I began to sway in my saddle. If he had but
      known and halted, he would have won an easy victory. Well, there were
      three good honest, satisfying wounds on three men,&mdash;each, I venture
      to say, worse than the one your brother got, and no doctor within thirty
      miles; yet the three of us are as hearty to-day as if we didn&rsquo;t know what
      a sword was made for. So have no fear about your brother. He&rsquo;ll be out and
      about by the time you are home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story reminds me of the Roman tale. It was a cowardly act of your
      three enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was rather that way. I did not heed their onslaught so much as
      their pretence of friendliness beforehand. Still, we mustn&rsquo;t be too
      critical when a feud is forward. Things are done then that we are sorry
      for afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge from what you say that you have forgiven the three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for that, I had forgotten all about them; it was your brother&rsquo;s
      case brought them to mind. I suppose I have forgiven them; but if I met
      them on the road here I&rsquo;d loosen the sword in its scabbard and be prepared
      for blade or hand, whichever they offered. But come, we have now a level
      road before us. Let us gallop. There&rsquo;s nothing so cheers the mind as a
      charge on a good horse. We will make old John stir his stumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They set off together, and old John did his best to keep them in sight.
      Some fourteen miles from York they baited their horses, then pushed on
      through Bawtry until Tuxford came in sight more than an hour and a half
      after noontide, a longer stretch than Armstrong thought good for either
      man or beast. It was not yet five in the morning when they left York, and
      with the exception of a bite and sup at their only halting-place they had
      nothing to eat until two o&rsquo;clock. Many of the numerous inns along the road
      were deserted and in ruins; the farther south the journey was prolonged
      the more evident became the traces of war, and Armstrong found that he had
      scant choice as to resting-places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said the girl, who knew the road, &ldquo;that &lsquo;The Crown at Tuxford
      has not been blown down again. It was a good inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More chance of its being blown up,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, flippantly. &ldquo;Was
      it blown down once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about half a century since, in a tempest, but it was rebuilt. You
      should have a kindly feeling for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess Margaret Tudor rested there in 1503, when she went to
      Scotland to marry your king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my forefathers, then, the &lsquo;Crown&rsquo; is a place of evil omen for me.
      Would that the fair Margaret had slept in it on the night of the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I ask, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because her son, James V, came down to the Border, and by treachery
      collected the head of my clan, with about forty or more of his retainers,
      and hanged them, denying either trial or appeal. Jamie missed those
      twoscore men later in life, when his cowardly crew deserted him. We
      Armstrongs seem ever to have been a confiding race of simpletons,
      believing each man&rsquo;s word to be true as the steel at his side. Margaret
      was as false as fair, and a poor Queen for Scotland, yet here am I now
      risking life or liberty for one of her breed, the descendant of those fell
      Stuarts who never honoured woman or kept faith with man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, what are you saying?&rdquo; cried the girl, aghast at the unheeding
      confession into which his impetuosity had carried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! You may well ask!&rdquo; said the young man, startled in his turn at the
      length he had gone. &ldquo;Still, it does not matter, for you would be the last
      to betray me. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it some day, and we will laugh over
      our march together, if you forget what I said just now. The end of our
      expedition is not to be the end of our acquaintance, I hope, and you live
      but a day&rsquo;s march from the Border. Will you let me take the day&rsquo;s march in
      your direction, now that I know the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make no promise until we reach home again. Then you may not wish to
      make the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little fear of that. I must see you again, if only to tell you of my luck
      in cattle-dealing, at which you showed such scorn yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let us speak of that. There is &lsquo;The Crown&rsquo; inn; and even if the
      shade of the Princess Margaret does not haunt it, I am pleased to see
      there are people more substantial around its doors. It is not deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is level with the times. The crown is blotted from the signboard,
      although some of the old gilding shines through the new paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon before they were on horse again, and they
      jogged down the road at an easy amble. Newark was passed, but they did not
      stop there longer than was necessary to show their permission to travel,
      for Newark had been a Royal town garrisoned for the King and besieged more
      than once. Armstrong had intended to stay the night there; but the
      authorities showed some reluctance in accepting a pass for two as convoy
      for three, and it needed all the young man&rsquo;s eloquence and insistance on
      respect for Cromwell&rsquo;s signature to get old John past the barriers, so
      when once this permission was granted he thought it well to push on clear
      of the place and risk the danger of camping out beside the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      His luck still stood his friend, and at Grantham, some ten miles farther
      on, as the sun was setting, they came to the ancient archway of &ldquo;The
      Angel&rdquo; inn, a house that gave every indication of furnishing the best of
      cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; cried Armstrong, &ldquo;we have shaken off the omens, and I find a
      lodging fit for you. &lsquo;The Angel&rsquo; for an angel, say I, and here it is. No
      haunting Margaret of the past, nor inquisitive Roundhead of the present to
      molest us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; laughed Frances. &ldquo;If ghosts walk these planks, you may
      wish the graceful Margaret in their stead. In one of the rooms of this
      house Richard III signed the death-warrant of the Duke of Buckingham. The
      place hints the fall of kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, lassie, you know too much history and too many legends of this
      gloomy land. I wish we were safe back in the North again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, as he helped her down from her horse.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he buxom landlady
      of &ldquo;The Angel&rdquo; remembered Frances and her four former visits to the inn,
      so she took charge of the girl in the most motherly way, fussing over her
      and seeing to her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing is changed here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though dear knows there&rsquo;s
      trouble enough in the land, and strife and what not; good men going away
      and never coming home again, or coming back broken and torn. I&rsquo;m sure I
      don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s in the right, but somebody&rsquo;s deeply in the wrong, and
      God&rsquo;s heavy hand is on us all. England will never be England again, I&rsquo;m
      thinking. I waited on the King my own self in these rooms when he went
      north not so long ago, and kind and gentle he was to all about him. I&rsquo;m
      sure I don&rsquo;t know what he has done that his own folk should rise against
      him and pen him up in Oxford, as if God&rsquo;s Providence had ended on earth,
      and His anointed was no more than Jack Lorimer the sweep. And the name of
      God is always on their lips, but I&rsquo;m thinking if they talked less of Him
      and were kinder to His creatures they would be fitter to meet Him when
      their time came. But, dearie, I must n&rsquo;t run on like this, for there are
      listening ears all about us, and a poor old body like me has been warned
      more than once. I fear it is not the King that is to blame, but them
      foreign people that&rsquo;s ever at his ear, and I thought little of them when
      they were here. There must be something fell wrong when the nobility
      themselves turn against him. Well I mind when the great Earl of Strafford
      himself came south and stayed the night here. If he had lived things would
      have been different, for he looked more the King than the King himself.
      Ah, he was a man for you! There, there, dearie, you&rsquo;re tired, and I go
      chattering along. But don&rsquo;t you cry again, dearie, for it&rsquo;s all long past
      and done with, and doubtless for the best, though our finite sight may not
      see that. What a babbling, thoughtless old wife I am; for I remember now,
      when you were here last, and I showed you the oriel window where Strafford
      sat, and told you the glint of your eye and the hold of your head reminded
      me of him, you sat there and wept and wept as if your heart would break.
      Kind-hearted you were, dearie, and I often thought of you and wondered how
      you were getting on. But now is not the time for tears, but for joy if
      ever you are to have it. I knew so comely a lass would not wander long
      alone, and that&rsquo;s a fine man you&rsquo;ve got. I saw how it was the moment you
      came, for the light in his face when he helped you down from your horse
      comes but once in a man&rsquo;s lifetime and your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, no! You are wrong. He is almost a stranger to me, but is a
      friend of my brother. He is nothing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me that? Well, well, we never know what the future holds for
      us, dearie, and unless I&rsquo;m very much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was travelling this way, and my brother asked him to give me company.
      My brother was wounded and could not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded? Oh, I am grieved at that. Many a brave lad&mdash;&mdash;is it
      dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it is not, but it frightens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, dearie; but them that know are like to be right, and we must
      always hope for the best. Now here&rsquo;s the meal for you, and you will not
      get a better between York and London. Your man&mdash;ah, there I go again&mdash;the
      stranger is looking to his horse, no doubt, as a careful traveller should,
      and we will see to him when he comes in, so do not you wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late when Armstrong returned from the stables, for old John&rsquo;s
      pack-horse showed signs of distress from travelling between seventy and
      eighty miles that day, and as the slowest horse in the party sets the
      pace, the animal had to be seen to and cared for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his bounteous supper the young man strolled about the rambling inn,
      and to his surprise came upon a lonely figure in a dim alcove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lass!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you should have been at your rest long ago. This
      will never do,&rdquo;&mdash;but he sat down beside her. The place was narrow and
      very cosy, as if the oriel window recess had been constructed for two
      lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not tired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and have much to think of, so I knew I could
      not sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should sleep well after so long a day in the open air. Deep thinking
      is the enemy of rest, and rather useless in the main. I&rsquo;ll wager you&rsquo;re
      wishing for news from the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see the uselessness of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, but how can one guide one&rsquo;s thoughts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it can be done. They say Cromwell has the power of dropping to sleep
      the instant he gets half an hour to himself. He has plenty to think of,
      and yet he must be able to guide his thoughts or abolish them for the
      moment, or he could not do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say also that he has some secret power by which he gets news before
      any one else, and thus appears where he is most needed at the time he is
      least expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt that. He has well-trained men in his service, which is the whole
      secret. Do you like Cromwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me. I thought you were a partizan of his. You remember what
      I said when we were approaching this inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye. But I said one in particular that I would have wished recalled if it
      had been said to any one but you. I promised to let you know all about it
      some day, but I&rsquo;ve thought over the matter and I&rsquo;m going to tell you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I do not wish to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen a moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I have been trying to forget what you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not fair to you that you should be exposed to an unknown scath.
      This did not occur to me when I set out, but your journey may be
      jeopardized because of my being deeper in dangerous projects than you have
      any suspicion of. So I have need to tell you my real errand in the South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Armstrong, I refuse to hear you. I will not be burdened with what
      does not concern me. Is your memory so short that you forget what has
      befallen yourself and your kin by trusting to strangers? I warn you to
      beware of me, and to treat me as if I were an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you must. I have no patience with a confiding man, who needs ever
      to be kneeling at the confessional. I wish to know nothing of your
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the confessional? Indeed, and you are right about that. But I have no
      desire to confess for confession&rsquo;s sake. I wished but to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I turn the tables and warn you. I ask you to think of the
      injustice of what you were about to do. If you are on some secret mission,
      there are others besides yourself involved. It is most unfair to them that
      you should make a confidant of any person without their consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say sooth. If you take my hint and promptly disown me should I become
      involved, I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can the more readily disown you if I know nothing of the traffic you
      are engaged in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say this inn is part of what was once the monastery of the Templars,
      and I think the influence of these warrior priests remain in it; for I,
      too, was tempted to confession when you came. But we must have none of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady, you would find me a more eager listener to a penitent than you
      proved to be. This alcove is like a niche in a temple, and doubtless has
      heard many a confidence since the Templars built it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows us a good example; it keeps silent about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were startled by a deep voice that broke in upon their discourse.
      They had heard no one approach, but now there stood before them at the
      outlet of the recess a tall, gaunt figure in the sombre garb of the
      Parliamentarian, as if he were the spirit of some forgotten Templar of
      whom they had just been speaking; indeed he seemed the modern embodiment
      of one of that fanatic, sinister band, for while his bearing betokened the
      fervid exhorter, a sword by his side indicated that he used the physical
      as well as the spiritual arm. His cheeks were sunken, and a two-days
      stubble on his chin emphasized not only the emaciation of his face, but
      the unhealthy clay colour of his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word with you. Who are you? Whence come you? Whither are you bound, and
      to what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; muttered Armstrong under his breath, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a father-confessor
      indeed, and right willing to take on the task with no misgiving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl wondered how long the apparition had been standing there, and
      rapidly ran over in her mind what had been said between herself and her
      companion since he came. Armstrong spoke up, and, while speaking,
      proffered his pass to the interloper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, that document will possibly satisfy all your questionings.&rdquo; The
      stranger, taking it, held it near the lamp and read its brief wording.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This answers none of my questions, except, and then by inference only,
      that you are perchance destined for Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the signature sufficient passport, so long as you do not find us
      south of Oxford or north of Carlisle? We are within the region over which
      the passport extends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the second time I propound my inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then for the first time I return them to you. Who are you? Whence come
      you? Whither are you bound, and to what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man answered without the slightest show of resentment against what he
      must have known to be an intended impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Hezekiah Benton, an humble preacher of the Word, and, if need be, a
      wielder of the sword. I came from Newark, and purpose returning thither,
      God willing, with more knowledge concerning you than you gave when you
      passed the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Benton, I will be equally frank, pausing to note with
      surprise that the signature of his Excellency General Cromwell is invalid
      south of Newark&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said not so,&rdquo; interrupted the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You imply as much by questioning after it has been shown to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are entitled to hold this pass, you will meet no obstruction
      within its limits. As no persons are named upon this paper, it is my duty
      to satisfy my superiors that it is not misused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Benton, but has it not occurred to your superiors that if
      General Cromwell had wished the names known he would have set them down as
      fully as his own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hezekiah thoughtfully scratched his stubbly chin, and was evidently
      nonplussed by the view so calmly presented to him. After turning the
      problem in his mind for a few moments, he replied: &ldquo;Nevertheless you are
      travelling on the London road. This pass reads Carlisle to Oxford. Newark
      is not on the highway between these two towns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably reasoned, Mr. Benton, and I envy those who have opportunity of
      hearing your discourses. They listen to good logic, I stand warrant. But
      the apparent mystery is soon dissolved. This paper was written by his
      Excellency at Corbiton Manor, in the county of Durham, at about this hour
      of the night three days ago, what time, if I may so put it, I was the
      guest of his Excellency at that place. If you will bear the county of
      Durham instead of the county of Northumberland in mind, you will observe I
      have taken the quickest route to Oxford, when the state of cross-country
      roads is considered. So far as the London direction is concerned, we
      deflect from it to-morrow at Stamford, and will rest, God permitting us,
      at Northampton to-morrow night. Any further questions will be as
      cheerfully answered, for I know you would not ask them without authority
      and a full explanation to give to General Cromwell, should he chance to
      dislike the uncovering of that which he was at some pains to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hezekiah Benton made haste in returning the passport to the suave and
      eloquent man from whom he had obtained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, your disquisition is most complete and satisfactory. If but a tithe
      of it had been given at Newark I would have been saved a hurried journey,
      and you a cross-examination. I give you good-night, and God be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May he see you safe in Newark again, and grant you length of days to
      expound His Word,&rdquo; responded Armstrong devoutly, as he rose from his seat
      and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances rose also when their visitor had taken himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are something of a diplomatist, Mr. Armstrong, but I fear diplomacy
      requires a touch of hypocrisy. Could you not have dismissed him without
      the benediction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? I meant it thoroughly. I am a religious man with a creed as grim as
      his own; a Presbyterian. I meant every word of it. He is a good man;
      notice how mildly he answered my scoffing return of his own questions. He
      made me ashamed of my frivolity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A religious man, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I had not thought of you as such. Your account of another
      man&rsquo;s pass did not seem strictly accurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true nevertheless. Every word I said was true. I never even hinted
      the pass belonged to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you cannot deny that he gathered a wrong impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was his fault, not mine. Hezekiah himself would tell you to
      possess the wisdom of the serpent as well as the harmlessness of the dove.
      But do not let me be too self-righteous. I will be honest with you, and
      admit at once that had a direct falsehood been necessary I would have used
      it. I was determined not to give him any name, for the pass I hold from
      Cromwell set Manchester as the limit, and we are now south of Manchester.
      I would have given the good Benton my name at York, but not at Grantham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that where great events are at stake,&mdash;a man&rsquo;s life
      let us say, or a country&rsquo;s welfare,&mdash;one is justified in using
      deception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly. I should have no hesitation in trying any ruse to save my
      friend or serve my country. Do you not agree with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to. Yes, I do agree with you. I do! I do! I do!&rdquo; she cried
      with a sudden fervour that surprised him, for it seemed out of proportion
      to the importance of the ethical question they had been discussing. He had
      been holding her hand all this time, and she seemed to become newly aware
      of that fact and hastily withdrew it, blushing as she did so. She spoke
      rapidly, as if to cover her confusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I use the words furnished me by our visitor. I give you good-night, and
      God be with you,&rdquo;&mdash;and she was gone before his unreadiness could
      frame a response.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;FRIENDSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext day the three
      were not as early beginning their march, because Northampton was barely
      fifty miles distant, and the day was longer than the way. The good
      landlady of &ldquo;The Angel,&rdquo; bustling and voluble, saw them off with many
      blessings, and wishings that God would speed them. Stamford furnished bait
      for their horses and a short rest for themselves. Then they took the
      deflecting road for Northampton, but their pack-horse limped and their
      progress was slow. Frances was in better spirits than was the case since
      the pilgrimage began, for she had now persuaded her mind, which eagerly
      wished to be convinced, that her future action would save the lives of two
      men,&mdash;Armstrong&rsquo;s not less than her brother&rsquo;s,&mdash;and so she had
      come to look upon her unsuspecting companion as her beneficiary rather
      than her victim. He himself had unknowingly been advocate against himself,
      and she was surprised to note how much influence his argument exerted,
      thinking it was because she was so anxious to be confirmed that the deed
      which circumstances compelled her to do had more of right than wrong in
      it. If he was indeed a Presbyterian, as he had said, his sympathies must,
      after all, lean toward the Parliamentary side rather than toward the Royal
      cause, and disappointment at the failure of his mission could not be very
      severe. She had heard him say nothing which showed enthusiasm or even
      concern for the King; in truth the remark which had inadvertently escaped
      him was to the effect that it was folly for one of his name to do service
      for the line of Stuart, and he had characterized the race as fair and
      false. Whatever motive, then, had sent him on this dangerous mission, it
      was neither love for the King nor loyalty toward his cause. Armstrong
      always spoke of himself as an outsider, having little interest in the
      quarrels of the English, whom he quite evidently regarded as an inferior
      race, easily overcome if fronted by real fighters. She smiled as she
      recollected his embarrassment once or twice in the midst of a diatribe
      against them, when he remembered just too late that he was talking to an
      Englishwoman. One fact, however, she failed to recognize, which was that
      in the intervals of conversation her mind was entirely filled with this
      blond Scot, to the exclusion of everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed pleasantly enough, even if progress was slow. Armstrong
      related many interesting or amusing anecdotes of the Border, and the girl
      came to the conclusion that life must be anything but dull in that hilly
      district. They partook of their noontide meal at a hospitable farm-house,
      for inns were few and mostly untenanted. They learned that it would
      probably be dark by the time they reached Northampton, but there was a new
      moon to light their way. They were off the main line of travel and had the
      road practically to themselves. At about five in the afternoon they heard
      the tramping of a squadron behind them, coming on at a rapid walk.
      Armstrong suggested that it would be well to draw into the hedge while the
      troopers passed, and this they did. The Scot sat easily on his horse,
      watching the somewhat imposing oncoming, the breastplates of the men
      scintillating in the declining sun, which shone full upon them. Suddenly
      Armstrong straightened and, unconsciously perhaps, his hand grasped that
      of the girl beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen Cromwell?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is he at the head of the cavalry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew away her hand, and sat there, scarcely breathing, fearful of the
      approaching encounter, which now could not be avoided. If Armstrong were
      equally perturbed he showed no sign of it, and she admired his nonchalance
      as she glanced momentarily at him. But her eyes turned instinctively again
      to the leader of the troops. There was something masterful in his very
      bulk; he seemed a massive man on his huge horse; power personified were
      horse and man. His unblinking eye faced the sun like an eagle&rsquo;s, and he
      came stolidly past them, looking neither to the right nor the left. The
      firm face was as inscrutable and as ruthless as that of the Sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four and four came the men behind him; some old, but erect; the majority
      middle-aged; all cast in the same mould as their leader. They sat like
      him, and looked straight ahead like him. Polished steel on head and front,
      but nothing ornamental in their outfitting. No drums, no flags, no
      trumpets; a shining, yellow bugle at the hip of the foremost,&mdash;that
      was all. Everything for use, nothing for display.. Clanking past they
      came, four and four, four and four, in seeming endless procession;
      weapons, and chains at the horse&rsquo;s bits, jingling the only music of their
      march. Not a word was spoken, not a glance to one side or the other. At
      last the final four went by, and Frances drew a breath of relief that a
      menace was past and done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he saw us?&rdquo; she whispered, not yet daring to speak aloud,&mdash;a
      precaution rather absurd, for she might have shouted while they were
      within arm&rsquo;s length of her, and she would not have been heard in the
      trampling of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw us!&rdquo; echoed Armstrong, &ldquo;yes, every thread of our garments. What a
      man! God of war, how I should like to fight him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you admired him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, more than any other on earth. If I had seen him before, I doubt
      if I had been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you to say you met him at Corbiton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met him, yes, by dim candle-light, smooth and courteous. But I never
      really saw him until now. You cannot rightly judge a man&mdash;a fighter,
      that is&mdash;until you have looked at him on horseback. That man knows my
      business. For the first time since I set out I doubt my success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you turn back?&rdquo; she asked, her voice quavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;m his Roland. If we do not cross swords, we&rsquo;ll run a race, and
      may the best man win. But I feel strangely uncomfortable about the neck,
      and I think of my ancestor Johnnie and the Scottish king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his chin and moved his head from side to side, as if the rope
      already throttled him. Then he laughed, and she gazed at him in fascinated
      terror, wondering he could jest on a subject so gruesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man is likely to defeat me,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;His plans are all laid,
      and already I feel the toils tightening around me. I am satisfied he knows
      every move I have made since I left him. The unseen spy is on my track,
      and, by my sword, I&rsquo;d rather circumvent him than rule the kingdom. Wull,
      whaur&rsquo;s yer wits? Now&rsquo;s the time ye need them, my lad. In the first place,
      I dare not go through Northampton; that&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my soul I&rsquo;m certain a crisis awaits me there. I&rsquo;ll be nabbed in
      Northampton. Then the question, &lsquo;Why did you refuse a pass to Oxford&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he offer you one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The next question will be,&rsquo; Why are you south of the limit set by
      yourself, travelling to Oxford on another&rsquo;s pass?&rsquo; To that query there&rsquo;s
      no answer. I&rsquo;m a self-convicted spy, and then the scaffold, according to
      all the rules of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me if I do not follow your argument. If he has tracked you, as you
      think, there is no more reason he should stop you at Northampton than at
      Newark or Grantham. Aside from that, why did he not hold you when he had
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had not put my neck into the noose then. As for arresting me at
      Newark or at Grantham, I see now that such was his intention, but our
      friend Hezekiah failed him. It was undoubtedly Cromwell&rsquo;s purpose that we
      should have gone back with Benton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I do not believe you. If Cromwell is as crafty as you seem to
      believe, it is likely he wishes you to reach Oxford. Unless that was the
      case, why should he have offered you the pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lass, there are several sides to this problem, and what you say has
      the stamp of probability on it. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll overset his
      arrangements. I am the only one of us three who cannot give good excuses
      for being in these parts. Here is the pass which protects you and old
      John,&rdquo; he said, giving her the document. &ldquo;You and he will to Oxford at
      your leisure. I shall gallop across country, will evade the Parliamentary
      lines as best I may, and will be in Oxford to-morrow morning. That will
      throw Old Noll a day out of his count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you leave me to meet Cromwell alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no need to fear the meeting. Your plea is perfect. Your brother
      was wounded, and you have undertaken his task. Of me or my plans you know
      nothing, and I was with you merely because I happened to be travelling
      this way, and had brought your wounded brother to his home. And here is a
      great warning to us all. Happy is the person who can abide by the truth;
      who has no secret designs to conceal. My lady, I envy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances made no reply, but sat there, bending her eyes on the ground.
      There could be no doubt that his new resolve was the best move in the
      circumstances, and she was not in a position to inform him that his night
      march was unnecessary, and that he would be wise to husband his horse&rsquo;s
      power until he left Oxford, for then would come his time of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us get on,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the first by-road south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cautious old John, with his limping horse, had gone forward while they
      stood talking together, and now they cantered to overtake him. Frances was
      glad of the cessation of conversation that she might have opportunity of
      meditating on some argument that would retain him by her side. If he left
      her, she was resolved to seek out Cromwell at Northampton, tell him of her
      brother&rsquo;s disaster, and explain her own effort to make good his absence.
      When Cromwell was convinced that both her brother and herself had
      faithfully endeavoured to carry out the Commander&rsquo;s wishes, he might then
      heed her pleading that sentence be annulled, or at least suspended, until
      the boy had another chance of proving his loyalty to his party. She
      thought she should succeed in this appeal for mercy, as she was sure
      Cromwell himself must know her brother was not a traitor. Her meditations
      were interrupted by Armstrong suddenly drawing in his horse and standing
      up in his stirrups. She also stopped and looked inquiringly at him. A high
      hedge bordered the road, and he was endeavouring to peer beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I caught a glint of a helmet over yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on at a walk, and shortly after passed a road that crossed their
      own. Up this cross-road to the north, two troopers sat on their horses;
      down the road to the south were two others. As Armstrong and his companion
      continued west, the four troopers came out of their concealment and
      followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St. Andrew, trapped! I&rsquo;m trapped as completely as ever was Englishman
      in Tarras Moss!&rdquo; muttered Armstrong.

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;AFFECTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he four troopers
      allowed the distance between themselves and the forward party neither to
      increase nor diminish until darkness set in, when they closed up, but said
      nothing. There was no further conversation between Frances and the young
      man. He held himself erect, and beyond the first exclamation gave no
      intimation that he was disturbed by the prospect before him. She was
      victim to the most profound dejection, and was relieved when the gathering
      gloom allowed her pent-up tears to fall unseen. The universal silence made
      the situation the more impressive. The sun had gone down in a bank of
      cloud which now overspread the heavens, threatening a storm and obscuring
      the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the lights of Northampton glimmered ahead, and shortly after a
      guard in front summoned them to stand. The troopers behind them also
      stood, but took no part in what followed. An officer examined their pass
      by the light of a lantern, but did not return it to them. His words seemed
      reassuring enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are stopping the night at Northampton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Armstrong, although the pass had been given up by Frances,
      and the officer&rsquo;s inquiry was addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any particular lodging in view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may meet trouble in finding a suitable abiding-place,&rdquo; said the
      officer, &ldquo;more especially for the lady. Northampton is little better than
      a barracks at the moment. I will take you to &lsquo;The Red Lion.&rsquo;&rdquo; Saying this,
      but without waiting for any reply, he led the way with the swinging
      lantern. &ldquo;The Red Lion&rdquo; proved a much less attractive hostelry than the
      hospitable &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; at Grantham. It seemed occupied chiefly by armed men,
      and resembled military headquarters more than an inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perhaps wish to see to your horses yourself,&rdquo; suggested the
      officer to Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, after I am assured that the lady is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no anxiety on that score. I will place her in the guardianship of
      the hostess, and will wait here for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assurance had all the definiteness of a command, and Armstrong,
      without further parley, led away his own horse and hers, followed by old
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way, madam,&rdquo; said the officer to Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He escorted her up a stairway, and at the top turned to her and said in a
      low voice: &ldquo;General Cromwell&rsquo;s commands were that you should be brought to
      him as soon as you arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at a door, and a gruff voice from within told him to enter. He
      opened the door and went in, followed by his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought the woman, General. The man is under guard below.&rdquo; Saying
      this, and receiving no reply, the officer laid the pass on the table and
      withdrew, closing the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell stood at the window, looking down on the dark street below,
      dotted with moving lights. His broad back was toward his visitor, and he
      did not turn round even when he addressed her. On a chair rested his
      polished breast-plate and steel cap, otherwise he was accoutred as he had
      been when she saw him on the road. His voice was hoarse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, wench, and what are you to this man, that you range the land
      brazenly together under a pass written for neither of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty the girl found her voice after two or three
      ineffectual attempts to speak, and said: &ldquo;I am Frances Wentworth, sister
      to Lieutenant Wentworth of General Cromwell&rsquo;s army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s ponderous head turned slowly, and he bent his sullen eyes
      upon her. She wondered Armstrong had not seen the brutal power of that
      countenance even by candle-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is your brother not in your place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother was sorely wounded the morning he set out, and now lies
      between life and death in our home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came he wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He met Lord Rudby, who attacked him. My brother would not defend himself,
      and so was thrust through the body. Armstrong brought him to our house,
      and the doctor says he cannot be moved for a month at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was I not informed of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know where to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, wench, surely did not know where to find me; but your brother knew
      that a message to his nearest superior would find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother, I have told you, was dangerously wounded, and had but one
      thing in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that? Lord Rudby&rsquo;s daughter, most like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rich colour mounted in the cheeks of Frances, but she answered slowly:
      &ldquo;It was to have done with the task you had set upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He committed it to your hands then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the task I set him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to steal from Armstrong the King&rsquo;s commission, and to deliver the
      result of that theft to General Cromwell, the receiver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wench, your tongue is over-sharp; a grievous fault. I pray you amend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until I have told you I am no wench, but a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had too much of lady&rsquo;s meddling in England, and will have less of
      it in days to come. A wench, if she be honest, is better than a lady, who
      is seldom honest. Your meddling in this matter has come near to causing a
      serious disarrangement of great affairs. How was I to know who you were or
      why you travelled? Has that foolish head of yours so little understanding
      that, though you stopped at York, at Newark, at Grantham, you gave no
      officer of mine a clue to your vagabondage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman can fulfil her duty without so much babbling of it. My foolish
      head never thought a great general wished his designs published from one
      end of England to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shaggy brows of Cromwell drew down over eyes that shot forth dull
      fire. He turned completely around, seemed about to speak, but did not. The
      flame of his glance died out, and he advanced to the table, picked up the
      pass, examining it critically, back and front. Then he handed it to her,
      saying slowly,&mdash;&ldquo;If your brother had your brain without your tongue,
      he would advance faster than he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, then, to go on with this adventure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You will reach Oxford to-morrow. The King will delay, and shuffle,
      and suspect, until our Scot is in a fine fume of impatience. For three
      days more I shall be in Northampton. After that for a week I shall be at
      Broughton Castle, some few miles west of Banbury. If you should be delayed
      longer in Oxford, I shall let you know where I am by means of De Courcy,
      who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Courcy!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what do you know of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is the same man who was in the <i>entourage</i> of the King in
      London,&mdash;a Frenchman of that name,&mdash;I know nothing good of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot look for every virtue in the character of a spy, and we who
      are doing the Lord&rsquo;s work must use the tools the Lord places in our
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has naught to do with De Courcy. He is a devil&rsquo;s man, body and
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell scowled at her. &ldquo;What mean you by that, hussy?&rdquo; he asked shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that De Courcy would sell you as readily as he would the King, if
      there was gold to be made of the bargaining. The Philistines come with
      money in their hands, and they always find a De Courcy, male or female.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Biblical allusion the face of Cromwell cleared like magic, and she
      had a glimpse of another facet of his character. A certain exaltation
      which had nothing of hypocrisy in it radiated from his countenance, and
      his voice rang clear when he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, my girl, and when there is a Samson of sin to be bound and blinded,
      the Philistines do right to accomplish the act as best they may. Judge
      not, that ye be not judged. Perchance this work to which your hand is now
      set is not done for either God or your country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be done for my brother&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, truly; and that is your Philistine&rsquo;s wage. De Courcey toils not for
      the life of another, but for gold, and let him that is without sin cast
      the first stone. I give the wage demanded, and care nothing so that God&rsquo;s
      work be done. God&rsquo;s work is the one thing important, so scorn not De
      Courcy or any other, but seek his aid in Oxford if it be necessary to
      communicate with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall I never do,&rdquo; muttered the girl under her breath; and if
      Cromwell heard he paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given thought to your purpose?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of nothing else; it has never been absent from my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you hope to accomplish possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to enact the scriptural part of the &lsquo;thief in the night,&rsquo;
      somewhere between Oxford and Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seated himself at the table, leaving her still standing before him.
      At these words the frown came again to his brow, and anger to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like your iteration; it is not to the purpose, and is but
      womanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a woman, and must bear the disadvantages of being so. As you have
      said, that matters little so that the good work be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between Oxford and Carlisle is vague. I cannot trust to a scheme so
      lacking in definiteness. I shall have Armstrong laid by the heels long
      before he reaches Carlisle. If the wench&rsquo;s hand fail, then comes the rough
      paw of the trooper immediately after. Your chance will be in Banbury,
      where you must contrive to have him stop for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we leave Oxford early in the morning he will not be content to stop in
      Banbury, which is less than twenty-five miles away, and even on the coming
      hither we have covered more than double that distance each day. He will be
      urgent on his return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but there lies your task in management; you may fall ill, and I
      question if he will leave you. I can order your pass taken from you at
      Banbury, and a night&rsquo;s delay caused. You will go to the inn called &lsquo;The
      Banbury Arms,&rsquo; at the sign of the blazoned sun. The inn-keeper will ask
      for your pass, and when he sees it he will place you in adjoining rooms
      which are fitted for your purpose. There is a communicating door, bolted
      on your side, invisible, except by close scrutiny, on the other. What
      follows will depend on your skill and quietness. Has the man any suspicion
      of your intention toward him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the least. He is honest and kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Do not dwell too much on his kindness in your thoughts, nor trust
      anything to his honesty. Make it your business to know where he keeps the
      King&rsquo;s letter, and when it is once in your possession speed at once to
      Broughton Castle and deliver it into my hands. I will exchange for it full
      pardon and a Captain&rsquo;s commission for your brother, and if you have
      further to ask my ear will be inclined toward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have nothing to ask except that this Scot be allowed to pass
      unscathed to his home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell gazed intently at her for a moment, and she returned his look
      clear-eyed and unabashed. He replied slowly: &ldquo;If I were willing to harm
      the Scot the case would be much simpler than it is. You left your home
      thinking only of your brother, but now the stranger occupies at least a
      part of your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is natural we should feel compassion for those we injure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short time before the General had intimated that her tongue was an
      unruly member, and for a moment it seemed that her impulsive inexperience
      in dealing with men was about to wreck her plans, for now even the girl
      was shrewd enough to see that she was sowing distrust of herself in her
      opponent&rsquo;s mind by incautious utterances. Cromwell leaned back in his
      chair, and a look of rapt meditation crept over his features. The girl saw
      she had vanished from his vision, and that the grim man was alone with
      himself, inwardly questioning his thoughts and demanding an answer. She
      realized intuitively that once this answer were given, nothing she could
      say or do would turn him from the purpose decided upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Youth, Youth!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;how unstable thou art! A broken reed;
      undependable! Give me the middle-aged; the steadfast. Youth is the flash
      of the burning flax; middle age the steady flame of a consuming fire. Is
      it not better to imprison this man secretly or hang him openly? He is a
      convicted spy; every law of war will uphold me. If I grasp the thistle it
      may sting me, but I shall uproot it. Yet&mdash;&mdash;yet, why at this
      time bring upon me the brawling Scots? Could I be but sure&mdash;&mdash;the
      brother risks all at the supreme moment and falls as the fool falleth. Why
      should she be more firm? Were I sure of her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you can be sure of me,&rdquo; cried the girl in a panic, terror-stricken
      at the sight his muttered phrases conjured before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! What! What! What say you?&rdquo; Cromwell shook himself as a man rudely
      awakened from sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you can be sure of me. I shall not falter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bring me this document?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to God I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, swear not at all. If a man&rsquo;s word bear him not up, he will sink
      when his oath alone buoys him. Wench, I will trust you; but remember this:
      if I am compelled to take this man through force of arms, to surround him
      with a troop and publicly wrench his burden from him, I must as publicly
      hang him, to warn the next Scot who would make the essay on Oxford. If you
      succeed, you save not only your brother&rsquo;s life, but this man&rsquo;s as well.
      Now go. Let there be no turning back from the plough to which your hand is
      set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances retreated and let herself out of the room. On the stair-head at
      the end of the passage, well out of possible earshot, two soldiers stood
      on guard, and between them an elderly woman, who immediately advanced when
      she saw the girl leave the General&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the landlady,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish a word with my friend,&rdquo; replied Frances. The woman appeared
      nonplussed, and stood hesitating; but at that moment the officer who had
      conducted her came up the stair and approached. &ldquo;I wish to speak with Mr.
      Armstrong,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, madam, if you please,&rdquo; replied the officer, knocking at the
      General&rsquo;s door. He was not bade to enter, but the single word, &ldquo;Oxford,&rdquo;
       uttered in a deep voice, came from within. The subordinate appeared to
      understand, and with a bow to the lady said: &ldquo;Mr. Armstrong is waiting
      below. Will you come down, or shall I ask him to come up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may tell him I wish to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked to the head of the stair and saw Armstrong alone in the lower
      hall, pacing up and down with a fine swagger of Scottish indifference,
      which he must have been far from feeling, while the doorway was blocked by
      two guards holding grounded pikes. The moment the young man saw her he
      came bounding up the stair two steps at a time. All the guards, above and
      below, seemed struck with simultaneous alertness, and made a motion which,
      if continued, would have brought their weapons to bear on the prisoner,
      but a slight signal from the officer&rsquo;s hand brought back their former
      stolidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Armstrong, I merely wished to know at what hour we set out
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do</i> we set out to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked in a whisper. &ldquo;Yes, there is no
      obstacle between here and Oxford. I was up so late last night, and that,
      with this long, dragging journey to-day, has tired me. All I wished to
      know was the hour for to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will have supper with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I can eat nothing. I am too tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s strange. I&rsquo;m as hungry as the Tweed at flood time. Let me
      persuade you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I would rest. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In all his life he never forgot that picture of the girl at the stair-head
      looking down upon him. There was a pathetic droop in her attitude which
      was usually so firm and erect, as if the gloom of this fortress-inn
      oppressed her. Childlike and forlorn she seemed, and a great wave of pity
      surged up in his heart for her, while his arms thrilled with a yearning to
      enclasp and comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; he cried, impulsively thrusting forth his hand to her. She
      did not appear to notice the extended hand, and he almost imagined she
      shrank from it. As she went away he had one more lingering look from her,
      over her shoulder. A smile, sad and weary, but inexpressibly sweet,
      lingered on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she whispered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;REJECTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here had been a
      lashing of rain and a clatter of thunder over Northampton in the night, as
      if the town were again besieged; but morning broke clear and beautiful,
      and when the pilgrims got out into the country again, the freshness of the
      air, the sparkle of the rain-drops on the trees, caused the world to seem
      newly made. The girl rode silent and thoughtful, but the young man was
      bubbling over with high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful magician is the morning after a rain in midsummer!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;It transforms everything and glorifies the commonest object, and
      it transmutes our thoughts from lead to silver. Last night, with the sky
      overcast and the coming storm growling in the west, when the air hung
      heavy and the gloom settled down upon us, every man was a lurking enemy,
      and that innocent tavern a place of dungeons instead of ale-cellars. This
      morning, hey, presto! a wave of the conjurer&rsquo;s wand, and every soldier is
      a jolly fellow and a well-wisher. I&rsquo;m ashamed to confess it in this bright
      light, but last night I was in a panic, like a lad passing through a
      graveyard. Never before did my spirits sink to so low an ebb. Those kindly
      men bustling round to be of help to me with the horses seemed, to my
      distorted brain, on the watch lest I should give them the slip, and when
      the guards were set at the door after I had entered and was waiting for
      you, I thought they were so placed to keep me prisoner, and when the
      polite officer told me they were there every night, I actually disbelieved
      him. Even his own actions seemed suspicious, but now, as I look back on
      it, he was merely one of the few courteous persons in the Parliamentary
      army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong suddenly threw back his head and laughed aloud, as if some
      humourous recollection had come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor officer must have thought me mad. When I came in from the
      stables I called for the landlady and asked where you were. She said you
      were in your room. I then requested her to find out if you would see me
      for a moment, and without reply she disappeared up the stair. I waited and
      waited, but she did not return. The officer was now by my side, chattering
      away about something to which I gave no attention. All at once the absurd
      idea struck me that you were with Cromwell, taken there by the officer,
      and that Old Noll was brow-beating you and threatening you, to learn
      something of me and what I was about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one asked me anything about you or your business,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. I see that plainly now, but I give you my word it was real
      enough then. Without a word of warning I broke in on the amazed officer
      and shouted, &lsquo;Where is General Cromwell?&rsquo; The man looked dumbfounded, as
      well he might; then he answered quietly enough, &lsquo;The General is in the
      Castle, half a mile from here.&rsquo; Even then a glimmer of sense came to me,
      and I explained that the General had passed us that afternoon, and I
      wondered if he had stopped at Northampton. The officer said he had, and
      next moment the landlady appeared at the stair-head, and you a moment or
      two after. What tricks imagination can play with a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was as anxious as you were last night, and shall always think of
      Northampton as the gloomiest town I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to be quit of it. I wonder if that officer has given us the
      right direction? It seems to me that we should be bearing further south
      for Oxford. But perhaps the road takes a turn presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road is right for the way we are going. We pass through Banbury,
      which is not much longer than the direct route. I intend to leave Old John
      at Banbury, and with him this permit, which will be a danger to carry
      until we turn north again. Banbury is on the straight road to Scotland,
      which I suppose will be the way you go on your return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right in that. I&rsquo;ll travel north as the crow flies if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what say you to making Banbury our first stop on the homeward run,
      after we leave Oxford, taking early to the road the next morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is Banbury from Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than thirty miles, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can do better than that. I must make from seventy to one hundred
      miles a day on my road home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is sometimes real speed in apparent slowness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. We shall be guided by circumstances, of course. Much will depend on
      the hour of the day we are done with Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances said nothing more, for she saw that the stop at Banbury would have
      to be managed from Oxford, and that it would require some tact on her part
      to arrange it. The ever-increasing moon was against her, for if there was
      much delay at Oxford, not only would Armstrong be the more impatient to
      get north, but night would soon be almost as light as day, and therefore
      travel would only be limited by the endurance of themselves and their
      horses. She wished Cromwell had selected some spot at least fifty miles
      farther away than Banbury, but, with a sigh, accepted the conditions
      presented to her and resolved to do her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Banbury she had no difficulty in leading her unsuspicious comrade to
      &ldquo;The Banbury Arms,&rdquo; and there they left Old John with his crippled horse.
      The landlord was a quiet, furtive-looking man, with a manner that
      suggested an intermittent glancing over the shoulder. Frances resolved to
      say nothing to him at this time, believing they had come so quickly from
      Northampton that she was in advance of any instructions he was to receive,
      but in this she was mistaken. With Cromwell to decide was to act, and some
      one had evidently come through in the night. While they halted, waiting
      the preparation of a meal, the soft-footed innkeeper, watching his
      opportunity, drew the girl aside and asked her if she possessed a pass; if
      so he would like to see it. He was very apologetic, saying all
      public-house keepers so near to Oxford were compelled by the military
      charge of the town to assure themselves that travellers who stopped with
      them were properly vouched for, otherwise it would be his duty to detain
      them and report to the local commandant. She presented the pass to him
      without a word, and he read it in silence, then looked at her as if he
      expected some comment. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you intend to stop here on your return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have you received instructions already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, and everything is prepared. Would you come up now and look at the
      room? Then, if for any reason I am not here when you come back, you will
      see that no mistake is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her to an upper room and explained to her the action of the
      concealed door, which moved without a sound on well-oiled hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the night you occupy this room. I shall have a horse ready, and
      will be in waiting for you myself until morning. I am to show you the way
      to the Castle. When you see the General, perhaps you would do me the
      kindness to tell him that this room was prepared within two hours after I
      received his commands. He likes prompt service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell him of your promptness if I remember to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Perhaps you will let me remind you of it when you ride to the
      Castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find the road to Oxford without impediment until you reach the
      lines of the King. I hope you will have a safe sojourn there and a speedy
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl thanked him for his good wishes with what courtesy she could call
      to her aid, for at heart she loathed him; his smooth, oily, ingratiating
      manner, and his shifty glance making her shiver with repulsion. Yet, she
      said to herself, conscience accusing, this man was merely an assistant in
      a deed where she herself acted the leading part. He was a mercenary,
      doubtless, doing what he was bid, but against a stranger and an enemy,
      while she plotted against a friend and a man who trusted her. Fervently
      she prayed that Providence might intervene between the resolution and its
      accomplishment, in some way rendering her project unnecessary. There was a
      slight hope that the suspicious King might not receive Armstrong as the
      envoy of the Scots. He carried no credentials, and Charles, if he employed
      him, must accept the Borderer&rsquo;s unsupported word that he was what he
      declared himself to be. She feared that Charles was in such straits that
      he would clutch at any straw, but hoped his natural distrust would come
      into play, so that Armstrong might return empty-handed to Scotland, while
      she would be relieved of this fell betrayal, from which, as events stood,
      she saw no way of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad was she to leave Banbury behind her, but tremblingly did she dread
      the time when she should see it again. The road, as the innkeeper had
      predicted, was clear, and now for the first time during that journey she
      was alone with her fellow traveller, Old John pottering over his lame
      horse in the stables of the Banbury inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits of the young man were as high as those of the girl were low.
      He saw that for some reason unknown to him she was depressed, and he tried
      to banter her into a more cheerful frame of mind; but, this effort
      bringing with it indifferent success, he broke out into song, and carolled
      to her some of the Border ballads, both sentimental and humourous, varying
      his chanting with explanatory excursions into the legends that had given
      rise to the verses. This was more successful, for few can withstand the
      magic of a sympathetic voice and a good song, especially when the summer
      afternoon was perfect, as all the days of their march had been. The birds
      on either hand warbled an accompaniment; the landscape was empty of
      humanity, and they had the fair world to themselves. If tormenting thought
      would but have left her unmolested, the girl knew she would have delighted
      in this irresponsible outing as thoroughly as her companion enjoyed it. To
      all outward appearance they were in a very elysium of peace, yet they were
      approaching the storm centre of the most distracted country on earth, and
      this seemed typical of her own situation, for although an enforced calm
      characterized her demeanour, despair was raging in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times the obedient Bruce, guided by an unseen touch, edged close
      to her, but Armstrong could not fail to perceive that the girl shrank from
      his proximity, and this abashed him, silencing his song and jocularity.
      But a lover must be bold if he would prosper. Here was a Heaven-sent
      opportunity, and what more can a man ask than that? In an hour or two they
      would be in the midst of a thronged city, where she would meet the friends
      she expected to see. Who could predict what might happen? It was possible
      she would elect to remain in Oxford. One or more of her friends might
      accompany her back to Durham. Now or never was the motto. Yet he had not
      the least notion how he ought to begin, but thought that in such a crisis
      a great deal must depend on the presentation of the case. Why had he let
      slip so many chances of getting information on a subject that now loomed
      with new importance before him? There was her own brother, to take the
      latest instance, who would have been glad to find a confidant, and needed
      but the slightest encouragement that morning in the lane to dissipate all
      the mystery surrounding a proposal. Thomas Wentworth had solved the
      problem, yet he was no older than this slip of a girl riding by his side.
      They had gone a mile or two in silence; a silence in marked contrast to
      his soniferous setting out. Frances feared that her seemingly sullen
      indifference had offended him, and, glancing surreptitiously at him from
      under her long lashes, met his own eyes fixed upon her. She smiled a
      little and said: &ldquo;Have you no more songs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one more,&rdquo; he answered, speaking hurriedly, &ldquo;but I have never sung
      it before, and am just a little in doubt how to begin. I think if I got
      the measure of it I could carry it on, but am not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that you have been thinking about so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There is a chorus to it, and there you must help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I if I don&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can sing a song I never tried before, perhaps you could do the same
      with the chorus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let me hear the song. Is it one of those fighting ballads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is a love song, pure and simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the others better. Brave and noble actions are the only deeds
      worthy of poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think that myself, but I have come to change my mind. It seems
      to me now that true love is the only theme for either song or story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl, with a coldness that froze instantly his budding
      enthusiasm. She sat up straighter on her horse, and turned her face
      resolutely toward Oxford, as if she did not approve the tendency of the
      conversation. Armstrong was stricken dumb at finding his indirect course
      thus blocked before him. The girl was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how soon we will be in sight of Oxford,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a long time, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that? Are you not as eager as I to reach Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some important matters to be settled before we come to the end
      of our journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances directed upon him a look of troubled resolution. Intuitively she
      knew that they were come to the edge of a declaration which she had hoped
      might be avoided. Several times on the way the danger seemed to approach
      and vanish, but now the glow of his luminous eyes were not to be mistaken.
      In them she read a consuming love of herself which was not to be balked,
      yet which must be balked, and so it became now or never with her, as it
      was with him. Whatever words he found would be less eloquent than the
      glances he had before now cast upon her, and it was well to have the event
      over and done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What important matters are to be settled?&rdquo; she asked firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All courage seemed to desert him under the intensity of her survey, but
      with the dourness of his race he urged himself forward, yet not in a
      direct line. Something of the military strategy with which he would
      approach a fortress insinuated itself into his love-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must decide in what guise you are to enter Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark certainly had the effect of throwing the holder of the
      fortress off her guard. It swept away the tribulation from her brow. After
      all, the case might not be so serious as she had thought, and jubilantly
      she welcomed the respite, for she had no wish to add a humiliation to the
      wrong which fate had decreed she should work upon him. She breathed a sigh
      of relief and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What guise? I&rsquo;m afraid I do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, hitherto we have been shielded by a pass. Its wording was such
      that little inquiry was made about either of us. Now, for the first time
      we have no protection, and what we say to those who accost us must prove
      our safeguard. I shall be asked who you are. I told your brother that I
      would treat you as if you were my own sister, but I cannot call you my
      sister at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one reason, because you go to meet friends who know that I am not
      your brother, and if inquiry is made we are at a disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true! I had forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another reason is that if we claimed such relationship no one would
      believe us, for your hair is as black as the raven&rsquo;s wing, and mine is
      like the yellow corn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time that day the girl laughed outright and lifted her eyes
      to the locks that so well became him. The simile of Samson again flashed
      upon her and checked her mirth, but she put the thought resolutely away
      from her. Armstrong laughed also, well pleased with his progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought of that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought of it, and also of a way to circumvent it. If they ask who
      the lady is, I shall tell them she is my betrothed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; gasped the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? as you asked a moment since. All&rsquo;s fair in love&mdash;&mdash;and
      war. The country is at war, and we may make true the rest of the adage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now close by her side and endeavoured to take her hand, but she
      held it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say no because you will not act a lie, and I honour you for your
      truth. You are robed in truth, my beloved, as an angel is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cease, cease, I beg of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, this is the song that bubbles in my heart, and if my lips could
      worthily fulfil their prompting, I would put it to such words and such
      music as woman never listened to before. But, lacking eloquence, I can
      only say, My lady, I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can only say I am sorry if this be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If! Why do you say if? Do you not know it to be true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it now that you tell it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must a man speak ere he can convey to the woman he loves the fact that he
      loves her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the woman love him not, he must speak, and still she finds his
      preference unaccountable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cannot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would even rob me of all hope, the lover&rsquo;s guiding star?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you call it robbing to take from you what should never have been
      possessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not have possessed that hope? Is it because I am untitled,
      while you are the daughter of the man who was the proudest peer in
      England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Titles have naught to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Titles are but a breath; still, men have intrigued for them, have sold
      their souls for them, as others have bartered for gold. That shall I do. I
      thought never to beg from any man, yet for this King I stake my life, and
      it is but fair he should cover my wager. I will say to him, I go to
      Scotland on your behest, through an enemy&rsquo;s country. Death or treachery
      dog every footstep I take. I may win or lose, but if I win, then I demand
      the stakes, which will not take a silver penny from your depleted
      treasury. Make me Earl of the Southern Marches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask a just reward, but &rsquo;twould be useless as assistant to the
      quest you now pursue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, no lover truly entitled to bear that dear name, thinks himself
      worthy of her on whom his heart is set, and I do not plead my own
      worthiness when I sue for your favour. But I am buoyed up by the thought
      that every day we live some woman marries some man, therefore are women to
      be persuaded, and there are none on earth but us to persuade them. Why
      should my fortune be worse than that of my fellows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you forget or ignore that every day of our lives some woman refuses
      some man, and never marries him. Why should your fortune differ from that
      of so many of your fellows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have pierced the armour there, my girl, so I own my simile defective,
      and fall back on my own unworthiness, to beseech your pity on it, and
      point the way to that amendment which will make me deserving in your
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you force me unduly. You drive me toward confession. Pitying God is
      my witness that I hold naught against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Frances, all is well with us. An English princess, as you told me,
      journeyed north to marry a Scottish king. Let us furnish a <i>quid pro quo</i>,
      for the King of the Border rides south to win an English princess. Here we
      are on the march together to meet the descendant of Scottish prince and
      English princess, so we cannot do better than follow the example of his
      forebears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, your precedent is unfortunate. The English princess made but a
      foolish wife for the royal Scot, and their descendant is a man whose word
      is a frail dependence. Indeed you said their house had exercised a fatal
      influence on yours, so beware the omens. Put not your trust in princesses,
      English or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put my trust on one as on an altar, and kneel before it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I warn you not to do. Many a man has lost his trust through such
      blind folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So shall not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are confident, and are likely to meet with confidence betrayed.
      You must accept my answer as final, and let us have an end of this
      fruitless and embarrassing conversation. I can never marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one circumstance to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then believe that circumstance exists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed joyously, but no corresponding smile disturbed the
      set lips of the girl. He should have seen how painful this dialogue had
      been to her, but with a lover&rsquo;s selfishness he had eyes for nothing but
      the object of pursuit; ears for nothing but the words he hoped to compel
      her to say; pursuing her thus from one point of refuge to another, each
      abandoned in turn, with no thought but that of capture. Her face was white
      with dread, a whiteness made the more striking by the jet framing of her
      hair. Never during the conference had she looked at him since the first
      direct gaze when she took the resolution to have this disturbing business
      put at rest forever. The horses walked on unguided, her eyes on the road
      immediately before her. When he accused her of loving another she glanced
      up at him for one brief moment, and answered before she thought, wishing
      her reply recalled as soon as it was uttered, for if she had agreed with
      him, he himself had said it was at an end. Bitterly did she regret her
      heedless destruction of the barrier which would have separated them. Now
      she must erect another, more terrible, more complete, be the consequences
      what they may.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you laugh. I am glad your heart is light, for mine is heavy enough.
      If I loved another, &rsquo;t were a small matter, for the man were not
      likely so estimable in a woman&rsquo;s eyes as you are. As I have said, you
      drive me toward confession, and here is one bold enough for a maiden to
      make. I admit you please me well, and if I had loved another&mdash;a
      woman&rsquo;s affection is fickle&mdash;you were like to benefit by its
      transference. But there is an obstacle between us more serious than the
      one you proclaimed sufficient. Take that as truth, and ask me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be the judge of the obstacle. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you never tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make full confession when this war is finished, if you ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we to do with the war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as a Scot. &rsquo;T is an unnecessary question, for you know
      all in England are entangled in its meshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it can have nothing to do with your feeling toward me, or my
      adoration of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge when you hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me hear now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Your persistence, when you see how distraught I am, dims your title
      of gentleman. A lady should not be coerced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your censure is just; but oh, pity my despair if this obstacle be real!
      It cannot be real. Whatever it is it shall dissolve before my burning love
      as mist before the sun. Tell it to me now, that I may show you that it is
      the fabric of a vision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl remained silent, her impetuous lover fiercely questioning her
      bowed head with his eyes. But as if in the interval of stillness a spectre
      intervened between them and brought a startled expression into his eyes,
      their intensity sharpened suddenly, and he said in a low voice: &ldquo;Do not
      tell me you are already married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I am?&rdquo; asked the girl hopelessly. &ldquo;Would the knowledge that
      such were the case end this useless discussion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by my salvation, it would not. If you admit but the slightest esteem
      for me, I will carry you to my castle in the North and hold it safe for
      you against the world. Are you, then, wedded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wedded to deceit. Sir, I am not worthy your love, or that of any
      other honest man. If you knew what it costs me to say this, you would let
      these words be the last we speak in this painful debate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceit? Not worthy of any honest man? Lord save you, child of sweet
      innocence, if this is all that troubles you, there is nothing in our way
      to the church. Your eyes are limpid wells of honesty. You could not
      harbour a deceitful thought if you tried. I would trust my life, my
      honour, my very soul to your keeping, assured that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God of mercy! why do you torture me?&rdquo; cried the girl in a burst of
      anguish, bending her head over the horse&rsquo;s mane. The astonished young man
      placed his hand affectionately on her shoulder, and felt her shudder
      beneath his touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest lass,&rdquo; he began, but never finished the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Halt!</i>&rdquo; came a sharp command. Armstrong looked up like a man
      awakening from a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fore God!&rdquo; he cried, wonder-stricken, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re on the outposts of Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ragged soldier barred the way, with musket held horizontally. An officer
      in a uniform that had once been gaudy, but now showed signs of hard usage,
      came out from the cabin at the side of the road when he heard the
      sentinel&rsquo;s challenge. Though his costume was so threadbare, he carried it
      with a swagger that had almost a touch of insolence in it, but this
      bearing melted to a debonair deference when he saw a handsome young woman
      before him. He lifted his hat and addressed her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. Have you the pass-word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am from Scotland and bear a message to his Majesty the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Scotland? May I glance at your credentials?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carry none. I have come through a hostile country; have been searched
      once or twice and arrested as often. Had there been writing on me I should
      not now be standing at the doorstep of Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do myself the honour of conducting you to the Chamberlain of his
      Majesty. And the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong took the girl&rsquo;s hand, this time without opposition on the part
      of its owner; it was cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady is my wife,&rdquo; he said boldly; then added, in a whisper heard only
      by herself,&mdash;&ldquo;that is to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer bowed and led the way to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we were in Scotland,&rdquo; said the young man very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; sighed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what I said at the outworks would then have constituted a
      marriage between us, if you had replied yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl withdrew her hand from his and turned away her head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;CHECKMATED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he one on foot and
      the two on horseback entered the fortress which had hitherto proved
      impregnable, and traversed its streets until they came to &ldquo;The Crown&rdquo; inn.
      Oxford was no longer the home of learning for any art save that of war. A
      few students still strolled its thoroughfares, but the military man was
      everywhere. The colleges had been turned into barracks and arsenals; the
      King himself lived in Christ Church, over the towers of which floated the
      royal standard, now almost the only red spot in all England.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the party came to a halt the officer turned to Armstrong. &ldquo;A propitious
      meeting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here comes the Lord Great Chamberlain himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong noted the approach of a man with a countenance so remarkable
      that it might have been taken as typical of war. From brow to chin was
      drawn a long red scar, while another ran transversely across the forehead
      just over the eyes, so that there flamed from his face an angry cross that
      gave a most sinister expression to a visage which, lacking these
      time-healed wounds, would have been handsome. The Chamberlain stopped
      abruptly in his advance, his gaze riveted upon the girl, and there came
      into his eyes a look of such malignity that Armstrong instantly turned his
      glance upon his travelling companion. The girl&rsquo;s cheeks had gone deathly
      white, and she swayed blindly in her saddle, perilously near to falling.
      The young man sprang from his horse and caught her just in time. Bitterly
      he blamed himself for this unexpected collapse, cursing his persistence on
      the road, when he had plainly seen that some strong emotion tormented her.
      This mental perturbation, combined with the physical strain she had
      undergone during their long journey, fully accounted for the prostration
      of the moment at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor lass,&rdquo; he said regretfully, &ldquo;I am to blame. I am a thoughtless,
      selfish hound to have so sorely troubled you with my insistence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; she whispered faintly, leaning heavily on him with the
      pathetic helplessness of a tired child, a dependence which sent a thrill
      of pity and love for her tingling to his finger-ends. &ldquo;Take me in; take me
      in quickly. I am ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the Lord Great Chamberlain, all smiles and courtesy, stepped forward
      and said with authority to the innkeeper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief rooms in the house for the lady. Turn out whoever occupies
      them, whatever their quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord called his wife, and Frances was given into her care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer introduced the traveller to the high official: &ldquo;My Lord
      Chamberlain, this gentleman says he has come from the Scottish nobles with
      a message for his Majesty. Sir, Monsieur de Courcy, Lord Great Chamberlain
      to the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frenchman and Scot bowed to each other, the grace of the gesture being
      almost entirely in favour of the former, despite his marred face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Armstrong to the officer, &ldquo;I thank you for your guidance; and
      you, my lord,&rdquo; to De Courcy, &ldquo;for your kind and prompt command with
      respect to the lady. She has had a long and tiring journey through a
      dangerous country, under continual fear of arrest, and so it is not to be
      wondered that a woman should succumb to the strain at the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our countries have ever been friends and allies,&rdquo; said De Courcy with the
      utmost amiability, &ldquo;and I trust that we, meeting on what is to each of us
      foreign soil, may be animated by a like regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, my lord, and, speaking for myself, admit that I have always
      looked with affection upon France and her brave and gallant sons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again De Courcy graciously inclined his head, and replied: &ldquo;And believe
      me, sir, if you were acquainted with her daughters, your affection for the
      fair land would not be diminished. I regret that I have never set foot in
      Scotland, but hope some day that such will be my privilege. The officer
      who has left us did not give me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am William Armstrong, somewhat known on the Border, a Scottish
      gentleman, and a loyal subject of his Majesty the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are very welcome in Oxford, and I am sure his Majesty wishes
      there were more like you in the environs thereof and the regions beyond.
      It is now too late to see the King to-day, and probably you are not loath
      to meet a night&rsquo;s rest after a hard day&rsquo;s riding. I will arrange a
      conference for you with his Majesty as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. If I may hint that every day is of value, you will perhaps
      urge upon the King the danger of delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not fail to do so. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life Armstrong left his horse to the care of
      others and entered the inn to inquire after the welfare of the lady who
      absorbed his thoughts. She sent word that she was quite recovered, but
      would see no one until the morrow. With this he was fain to be content,
      and he wandered about the town in the gathering dusk, hoping to do her a
      service by discovering the whereabouts of Lord Rudby&rsquo;s son, to whom he
      supposed she carried some message from her brother. He learned that this
      young man, who was a captain in the King&rsquo;s army, had been sent, it was
      supposed, to London, but nothing had been heard of him for a month or
      more, and whether he was prisoner or not, none could say. This
      intelligence depressed Armstrong, who feared that the girl had taken her
      long journey for nothing, and that the failing to find the one she sought
      might entail serious consequences upon her brother or herself, for each in
      turn had manifested great concern touching the mission she had undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning his first visitor was the Lord Chamberlain, who expressed
      deep regret that the King was indisposed and could not see any emissary
      from the Scots that day. The high official spoke feelingly of the
      disappointment the monarch had been called upon to endure through the
      unmerited success of his rebellious subjects, and this statement seemed to
      the traveller only what was to have been expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day Armstrong was privileged in securing one brief interview
      with Frances. The landlord had placed two rooms at her disposal, and in
      the scantily furnished parlour the young man had called upon her. The
      improvement she had affirmed the evening before was scarcely borne out by
      her appearance, for she was wan and dispirited, so much so that when
      Armstrong announced the disappearance of Captain Rudby, the tidings did
      not seem to depress her more than was already the case. However, the news
      clung to her mind; for, as he was telling her that the King could not see
      him that day, she suddenly said, in a tone which showed she had not been
      listening, that as Captain Rudby was not in Oxford, there was no reason
      why she should stay. She would go on at once to Banbury, and there await
      the coming of Armstrong. But the young man would not hear of such a
      course. It was impossible, he said, that an unprotected lady in the
      disturbed state of the country should travel alone between Oxford and
      Banbury. It was not likely that he would be held from the King more than
      another day, and then they would both set out together. Besides, she
      needed all the rest she could obtain before they turned north again. The
      girl was too deeply dejected even to argue the question, when he so
      strenuously opposed her desire. It seemed that a contrary fate was
      tightening the coils around her, and all struggle against it was
      fruitless. There were unshed tears in her eyes as she glanced timidly up
      at him, and she had the haunted look of one who was trapped. The
      unforeseen meeting with De Courcy, although Cromwell&rsquo;s words should have
      prepared her for it, had completely unnerved her; that nightmare face of
      his confronting her whenever she closed her eyes. The past had come up
      before her in its most abhorrent guise. She remembered striking him
      fiercely with the jagged iron she happened to hold in her hand, and
      thought anything was justified that enabled her to escape his clutches,
      but that he would carry so fearful a disfiguration to his grave chilled
      her with fear of his vengeance; for if ever murder shone from a man&rsquo;s eyes
      it glared in his when she caught his first glance the evening before. All
      during the night the terrifying vision drove sleep from her couch, and she
      pondered on some possible method of escape, but without result. How gladly
      she would have confided her peril to Armstrong, did she stand in honest
      relation to him, but she could not bring herself to ask help from a man
      whom she had just rejected and whom she would shortly rob. When Armstrong
      mentioned the absence of Rudby, she had utterly forgotten that the
      ostensible reason for this Oxford journey was to see him, and for a moment
      it appeared that here lay a loophole of escape, but Armstrong&rsquo;s outspoken
      opposition to her plan left her with no adequate excuse for persisting in
      it. All force of purpose had deserted her, and it seemed impossible that
      it could have been she who for the sake of a father she had seen but once
      had braved the rage-mad Queen of England and threatened the monarch
      himself in his own court in the height of his power. What subtle change
      had come over her imperious will? What alchemy had converted the strong
      wine of her resolve to vapid water? It was not personal fear. She had met
      De Courcy before, and even when he had her at his mercy, lured into his
      private room, her high courage never faltered. But now her whole impulse
      was to call for aid from another; to have that other protect her, and to
      obey his slightest wish. Here was a mutability indeed for the daughter of
      the strenuous Strafford! This feeling was something new, something
      strange, something unaccountable. And that other stood before her, anxious
      to heal her hurt, but diagnosing wrongly, powerless to apply the soothing
      balm. She wished him there, for his strong presence calmed her; yet she
      also wished him gone, that she might collect her scattered thoughts.
      Absent or present, he disturbed her, and she wondered if this could be
      love, which she had imagined brought peace and joyous content.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this unsatisfactory coming together, little was said by either. The
      girl sat in a chair by a small table, and he stood on the other side. Most
      of the time her head rested on her hand, and he saw she was near to tears.
      He censured himself again for his ill-timed avowal of the day before, but
      saw no method by which he could annul its consequences save by saying
      nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day of his stay in Oxford the suave De Courcy was compelled
      to bewail the continued indisposition of the King. There were various
      important matters awaiting his Majesty&rsquo;s attention, he said, but nothing
      could be done until his recovery. Meanwhile, to pass time that must be
      hanging heavily on the visitor&rsquo;s hands, the thoughtful Frenchman suggested
      that Armstrong should indulge in a stroll around the fortifications.
      Oxford was believed to be unassailable, but De Courcy would be pleased to
      hear any criticisms the new-comer cared to pass upon the defences.
      Armstrong expressed his concurrence with this proposal, and thought at
      first that the obliging foreigner was to be his guide; but shortly after
      they set out, De Courcy introduced him to an officer who was to be his
      cicerone, and excused himself because of the King&rsquo;s illness, which had
      placed on his shoulders many duties that had heretofore been absent from
      them. As soon as the two were out of sight, De Courcy hastened back to the
      inn, passed up the stair, and knocked at the door of the room occupied by
      Frances Wentworth. On receiving permission to enter, he went in and closed
      the door behind him. The girl, who had expected a different caller, rose
      from her chair and stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, this is a meeting which I have long looked forward to with
      pleasant anticipation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I regret that I have no share in your felicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you prefer that we should meet as enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer that we should not meet at all, and, knowing this, you may be
      good enough to make your visit as short as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot find words to express my sorrow, on learning I am so unwelcome.
      I am sure that when last we met, I did my best to make your visit as long
      as I could, so why should you wish to shorten mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to the girl that there was something unnecessarily shameless in
      his allusion to a circumstance that had so disfigured him. As she made no
      reply, he went on with airy nonchalance: &ldquo;Will you excuse me if I lock the
      door, and, showing that experience is a proficient schoolmaster, I ask the
      extension of your forgiveness to cover the act of putting the key in my
      pocket. We live and learn, you know. Not that I fear any interruption, for
      the innocent and excellent Scot is at this moment investigating our
      battlements under the care of a shrewd guide, and will not return this
      three hours or more.&rdquo; The polite intruder locked the door and put the key
      in his pocket; then advanced toward her. She retreated to the other room,
      and for a moment he thought she was about to barricade herself within, but
      she reappeared on the instant with a jewelled dagger in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you, sir, that if you approach within striking distance I will
      pierce you to the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman smiled and waved his fine white hands with a gesture of
      inimitable grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairest of the Wentworths,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the glances of those lustrous eyes
      have already pierced that sensitive organ. Alas, that it is my fate they
      should beam upon me in anger. Well, my Lady Wentworth, you see I do not
      approach you, but grant my bravery the justice to believe that it is not
      fear of the sting that prevents my sipping the honey. May I sit down, and
      if I place this table between us, will you feel safer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> will be safer so long as it remains between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you my own safety weighs but lightly with me. I implore you to
      be seated, for I cannot converse at ease with a lady who is standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to stand. Your ingrained courtesy will then cause you to make
      our conference brief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It distresses me to say that you are prolonging the conference by
      standing. We have grave particulars of state policy to discuss, and I
      cannot begin while you are so cruel as to put me in the light&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; cried Frances, impatiently, taking her own chair;
      whereupon he, elegantly gracious, seated himself opposite her, with the
      table between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ideally charming you look! I swear there is none to compare with you,
      even in that land of loveliness to which I have the honour to belong. Will
      you believe me when I say that there has not been a day since I last saw
      you, that I have not thought of you. I was angry at first, as you may well
      imagine, but at last I saw that I had been to blame, although I think the
      punishment must have obliterated my crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a few moments, but, she making no reply, he continued:
      &ldquo;Grief for the loss of you filled my heart. You think I come here as an
      enemy, but I come as a suppliant. In the folly of that time at Whitehall I
      refused you marriage, and I do not wonder you were wroth at me. I wish to
      atone for what you justly considered an insult, and am willing to marry
      you in the face of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ask no questions anent this awkward Scot who has been your
      courier, for I am sure you can have thought nothing of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You return thanks coldly, but I know that is the English nature. The fire
      of France is not to be expected in this northern clime, but if you say yes
      to my pleading, I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wished for fire I would go down and not abroad for it. I had sooner
      wed the fiend from the pit than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were a sulphurous mating indeed! Still you see how I adore you when
      I restate my determination to occupy the devil&rsquo;s place at your side before
      the altar. You but whet my expectation, for I should dearly love to tame
      you as your Shakespeare tamed his shrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you shall never do while a hand&rsquo;s breadth of steel will rid me of
      you, or myself of the world. Escape is too easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from an Oxford dungeon, my dear. This mediaeval town furnishes us
      with dark pits in which there is no fire, and consequently they have a
      cooling effect on the hottest temperament. These are pits of which I am
      the fiend. My dear, you underrate my power, or overrate my patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are English gentlemen in Oxford. On what plea could you induce them
      to think that an English lady should be placed in a dungeon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are English gentlemen here, and some French gentlemen as well.
      They are unanimous in their detestation of a spy, male or female. Your man
      we shall hang out of hand, and there will be little difficulty about the
      pleasing task. I shall myself plead that your life be spared, and they
      will agree. Everything will be done with that beautiful legality which the
      English so much admire, but even from this moment you are entirely in my
      power, and a sensible woman should not need so much argument to convince
      her that the situation is hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armstrong is no spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have difficulty in proving he is not. I am glad to note that you
      admit by inference that you are a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prove he is not a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your evidence would be tainted. You are an accomplice. Besides, you could
      not clear him without condemning yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such will I gladly do. I glory in that I would sacrifice myself with joy
      to save William Armstrong, the awkward Scot, as you called him. What would
      you give to hear me say this of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much, my dear, much. Oh, I delight in you! You know how to sting without
      using your poniard. But I am not of a jealous nature, and love conquest
      for its own sake. I have told you I care nothing for the Scot, and you
      might easily have had him journey for the North again if you had not been
      so impetuous. Now I shall hang him, merely as the first step in breaking
      the stubborn pride which adds such zest to your overcoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word from me to Armstrong will transfer the danger to you. He will
      break you like a reed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my dear, you do yourself injustice in threatening me. You shall
      have no opportunity of speaking your one word, for when next we meet, if
      we part now without coming to amicable arrangement, you will be on your
      knees to me pleading for his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I not. I shall go to the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, you dishearten me, and cast grave doubts on the possession of
      that sound sense with which I credited you. Was your first appeal to the
      King for a man&rsquo;s life so successful that you build hopes on a second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Charles had kept his word with me then, he would not now be encaged in
      Oxford. He abandoned my father and clung to such as you, and not a foot of
      English ground remains to him but what he stands on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would have happened had Strafford lived, neither you nor I can tell,
      and all discussion thereon is aside from our present purpose. Will you
      make terms with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prefer the dungeon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare not imprison me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master will not allow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman leaned upon the table, a patient beneficent expression on
      his scarred features, and spoke to her gently, as one who must deal with a
      petulant, unreasonable child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, let me put a quietus for ever upon your mad idea that any help
      is to be expected from the King. I beg you to believe that I speak the
      exact truth. Do you know what the King thinks of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not think of me at all. He has forgotten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. There you are mistaken. He thinks you came to Whitehall the
      day of your father&rsquo;s death to assassinate him. He believes that I
      imperilled my life to save his. The scars of your claws, however repulsive
      they may be to others, are to him a constant reminder of his supposed debt
      to me. Judge you then, my dear, what your position in Oxford would be did
      the King but dream you had crept surreptitiously into his stronghold. Need
      I say more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But you should have paid better heed to what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said your master would not permit you to injure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have shown you that the King&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking of the King. Your master is Oliver Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either the cross on his face became redder, or the sudden pallor of his
      other features made it appear so. Slowly he withdrew his elbows from the
      table and leaned back in his chair, moistening his lips, gazing on the
      girl with the intensity of a new-born fear. She sat motionless, returning
      his look without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the room was as silent as if it were deserted. At last he
      spoke huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to gain by making so absurd a statement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose with a gesture of impatience, walked to the window and back;
      then to the window again, and unfastened a latch that let free a latticed
      sash, as if the room stifled her and she wanted air. Then she exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Oh, let us have a truce to this fooling; I am tired of it. You say I
      shall beg on my knees to you, but you have mistaken your own attitude for
      mine. Why do I make such a statement? Because Cromwell told me in
      Northampton that if I met difficulty in Oxford, you, his spy, would assist
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye! Good God! You did not think such a man would blab out secrets of
      death to a woman, but there is this to say on his behalf, that he was
      merely recommending one spy to another. He thought mutual safety would be
      their bond of union, and he was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew you would meet me in Oxford? Why did you seem so distraught
      when the event happened? That was acting, I suppose, to fall the easier
      into the arms of the Scot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no need to act to bring that about. I hoped to avoid you, and would
      have done so but for the chance encounter. And now you see, sir, that my
      peril is as nothing to yours. My countrymen will not injure me; I know
      them better than you do, but even if it were otherwise, I have but to bend
      my strength to the pillars and crush you and myself in the ruins of the
      falling house,&mdash;an enactment, I assure you, that fits my nature
      better than the part of Delilah into which I am cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would not believe one self-convicted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would not believe me? I dare you to put it to the test. Believe me?&rdquo; She
      stood by the window and held up her hand. &ldquo;I have but to strike open this
      leaded pane and cry to the officers passing in the street, &lsquo;I am the
      daughter of Lord Strafford, help me, for here I am caged with a French
      spy, a creature who has sold King and comrades for Cromwell&rsquo;s gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, woman, do not speak so loud. There is no need for frenzy.
      I did but jest when I spoke of molesting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in no jesting mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not need to tell me that. I am quite willing to further your
      behests, if you but trust me and tell me what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you expect me to trust you?&rdquo; asked the girl, coming back to the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now standing on the other side, all self-confidence gone from his
      attitude, speaking almost in a whisper, so anxious was he that she should
      have no excuse for raising her voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I have not earned your trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you have. I trust you implicitly because you stand under the
      shadow of the scaffold, and at a word from me the bolt is drawn. You will
      postpone all thought of revenge until your neck is out of the noose; of
      that I am very well convinced. I refuse to make terms with you, but I give
      my commands which you must rigidly follow unless you court calamity. You
      will take Armstrong to the King, and cease to block his way. You will see
      that we are free to leave Oxford, and are unmolested while we are within
      these walls. One false move and you bring your doom upon you. While we are
      in Oxford the rope is round your throat, so pray to the demon who aids you
      that we may make speedy and easy exit. Shudder to think that your fate
      hangs on the action of a woman, wholly unstrung, and that even a
      suspicious look from any officer in this garrison may instantly
      precipitate the disaster you apprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you to be calm, madam. I swear I will carry out your orders to
      the letter. Do not, I beg of you, take panic at any chance word by
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlock the door and leave me. See that you do not come again.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;DESTINY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning of
      the fourth day Armstrong was delighted to learn from De Courcy that the
      King had recovered and would see him at noon. The foreigner engaged the
      envoy in a long conversation, the object of which was to discover whether
      or not the girl had said anything to him of the excited conference of the
      day before. The unsuspecting Scot, entirely off his guard, thinking he
      spoke with a friend, was read by the other like an open book, and De
      Courcy was speedily convinced that Frances Wentworth had kept her own
      counsel. This gave the spy renewed confidence, and as they walked down the
      street together De Courcy held his head higher than had been the case when
      he last turned his back upon &ldquo;The Crown&rdquo; inn. His buoyant nature was quick
      to recover from depression, and his malice, fed anew from his late rebuff,
      set his alert mind at work to contrive some plan whereby he might salve
      his wounded pride and avenge himself on the girl and his favoured rival,
      even at some slight risk to himself. Although the danger of exposure
      seemed imminent enough when he was with her, he knew that as she grew
      calmer and reflected upon the situation she would be more and more
      reluctant to wreck everything in order to bring punishment upon him. He
      would get them out of Oxford that day if possible, but he would instill a
      poison in the young lover&rsquo;s mind that would take all sweetness from the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy had offered to show Armstrong the way to the King&rsquo;s rooms, so
      that there should be no delay when the Scot set out for his appointment at
      twelve o&rsquo;clock, and they had now entered the quadrangle of Christ Church,
      which was deserted save for the guards at the gate. Armstrong thanked him
      for his guidance, and was turning away, when the other, who seemed about
      to speak, glanced at the soldiers on duty, then, thinking the spot ill
      chosen for what he had to say, invited the Scot to his room. They went up
      a stair together, and entered De Courcy&rsquo;s apartment, the host setting out
      wine and asking his guest to seat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the lady who accompanied you quite recovered from her fatigue?&rdquo; asked
      De Courcy, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I told you, I met her yesterday for a few moments only, and I am
      sorry she was not in the highest spirits, but she will be the better for
      seeing the green fields again. Like myself, she is of the country, and
      does not thrive within the walls of a town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I noticed that when she was in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In London? Did you know her in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hasn&rsquo;t she told you of our relationship? Perhaps I should not have
      mentioned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by your relationship? You are French; she is pure
      English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy threw back his head and laughed, unheeding and indeed unnoticing
      the angry colour mounting in a face that had grown suddenly stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear comrade, there are other relationships between a young man and a
      handsome woman than the ties of kinship. But those days are long past, and
      I should never have recalled them had it not been that you two have been
      travelling about the country together, I make no doubt, with an innocence
      that recalls the sylvan days of yore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong pushed back his chair and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the lady took her brother&rsquo;s place, he being unexpectedly and
      grievously wounded. My position has been that of true comrade to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I have said. I said your journey was one of
      Arcadian innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were your words, but your tone bears a meaning I resent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite in error. I will say no more about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already said too much or too little. Tell me in plain words what
      this relationship was to which you have referred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First answer me a question. Are you betrothed to Frances Wentworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I told you I acted the brother&rsquo;s part toward her in this journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all say that; but I am not in the least curious. If you intended
      to marry her, then were my mouth sealed. Very well; since you will have
      it, and I take your word as a gentleman pledged that you will say nothing
      to the girl of this until you are clear of Oxford, know that I was once
      her betrothed. She was to have been my wife, and would have been my wife
      to-day had her father not fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Her father gave me permission to pay my court to her. She could not
      have been much more than sixteen then, and I was her first lover, a
      personage that a girl never forgets. At first she was frightened, but that
      stage did not last long. Her father&rsquo;s ruin changed my plans, and I refused
      to marry her. I announced this refusal to her in the seclusion of my own
      room in Whitehall and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong&rsquo;s sword seemed to spring of its own will from the scabbard, and
      his hand drew it a-swish through the air with the hiss of a deadly
      serpent. The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders, but did not move. The three
      words of his opponent had been spoken very quietly, despite his impulsive
      action. De Courcy did not raise his voice as he asked: &ldquo;Which of my
      statements do you question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that. We fight on this phrase in Scotland. No man ever
      called me liar and lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is a coarse phrase, I admit, and did I not represent my King&mdash;were
      I as free as you&mdash;you should have had my response in steel ere this.
      But I cannot wreck the King in a private quarrel of my own. Whether you
      killed me, or I you, &rsquo;t would be equally disastrous to his
      Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care nothing for the King. Draw, you poltroon, or I shall kill you
      where you sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Armstrong, I refuse to be murdered under a misapprehension on
      your part. I have said nothing against the girl. &rsquo;T is all your own
      hot blood. And indeed your brawling is the girl&rsquo;s greatest danger; she
      might well tremble if she knew your present occupation. If you run your
      nimble sword through me, you give the girl to the fate that befel her
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first word of danger to Frances the point of Armstrongs blade sank
      to the floor, and he stood hesitating. A gleam of triumph glinted and died
      in the eye of the Frenchman. He knew he was the victor, although the
      chance he had run at one stage of the game almost made his heart stop
      beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can any action of mine jeopardize Lady Frances Wentworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the King knew this girl was within his jurisdiction, she would be
      instantly arrested, tried, and condemned. She entered Whitehall the day
      her father was executed, for the sole purpose of murdering Charles. I
      prevented the carrying out of that purpose, and these scars on my face are
      the results of my interference with a maddened woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, you lie, yet if she had killed you both she would have
      accomplished but the justice of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the truth or falsity of my statements, regarding which you make
      comments of unseemly terseness, you may ask the King when you see him, or
      you may ask the lady herself when you get her out of Oxford. If you
      precipitate a turmoil here, you are like to tumble her pretty head in the
      basket. When this war is done with, I will go far to teach you the correct
      method of addressing a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong&rsquo;s sword dropped into scabbard again, and he drew a breath that
      was a sigh. The poison was already at work. He remembered the distress of
      the girl on the road, and her wail, &ldquo;I am not worthy the love of any
      honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never question her or any other, but will believe her lightest
      word against the world when she condescends to tell me. Meanwhile I shall
      get her out of this thieves&rsquo; den as soon as may be, and by God when I meet
      you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy had risen, and now bowed slightly to his perturbed guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you shall meet me at twelve, and it will be my privilege to conduct
      you to his Majesty. Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the window overlooking the quadrangle and watched his late
      visitor cross it, staggering once as if he had partaken freely of the wine
      which remained untasted on the table. As the Scot disappeared under the
      archway De Courcy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fine, strutting cockerel,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you by the heels
      before two days are past. Cromwell&rsquo;s at Broughton, curse his tattling
      tongue. How many more has he told of me? Never mind. He&rsquo;s the coming man.
      The King&rsquo;s game is up, and I shake the dust of Oxford from my feet
      to-night. Saint Denis, if she had only known! Every man in Oxford
      distrusts me except the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Armstrong was brought before Charles, a great pity filled him as he
      gazed for the first time on that gaunt, haggard face, the face of a beaten
      man with his back to the wall. He found no difficulty in convincing the
      King that he was a well-accredited envoy, and his Majesty inquired eagerly
      about the disposition of the Scottish people toward him, the number likely
      to take the field in his behalf, who their probable leaders were, and how
      soon they would be ready for the fray. All these questions Armstrong
      answered as hopefully as he could, in deep commiseration for a defeated
      man. The King commanded one of his secretaries to write out the required
      commission, and while this was being done Armstrong related to him the
      purport of the papers which he had not dared to bring with him. The names
      of the nobles were inserted in the document from the dictation of the
      Scot; then the King&rsquo;s seal was affixed, and Charles signed the parchment.
      He seemed in feverish haste to get the business done with, as if every
      moment lost was irreparable. When the ink was dried, and the parchment
      folded, Armstrong placed it in safe keeping within his vest. While thus
      engaged the King said a word to the secretary, who handed him a light
      rapier, then whispered to the messenger the single word &ldquo;Kneel.&rdquo; The Scot
      flushed to think he had been wanting in the etiquette of the court, his
      kind heart yearning to proffer any deference which should be rendered to a
      monarch, more especially that he was no longer in a position to enforce
      homage. He dropped on one knee and bowed his head. Charles, rising,
      touched the rapier blade lightly upon the shoulder of the kneeling man,
      saying: &ldquo;Rise, Sir William Armstrong, and be assured that if you bring
      this poor signature of mine to Scotland, there is no title in my gift you
      may not demand of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong rose, awkward as a school boy, not knowing where to look or what
      to say until he caught the cynical smile of De Courcy standing at the
      right hand of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, Sir William,&rdquo; said the Frenchman. The sight of the
      smile aroused the new hatred against the man which was smoldering in his
      heart, and he made no reply to the greeting, but said to the King: &ldquo;Sire,
      the only thanks I can tender you is haste to the North, and may God make
      my arm as strong to defend this signature as my heart is true to your
      Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he turned his back upon royalty, a grievous breach in the eyes
      of courtiers, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; said the King, with a sigh, as he sank once more in the
      seat from whence he had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt of it,&rdquo; said De Courcy, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt of what?&rdquo; asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oath he took will sit lightly on his conscience. He prayed that his
      arm&rsquo;s strength might equal his heart&rsquo;s fealty. I distrust those who talk
      glibly of their hearts, and his was a most ambiguous prayer. If his heart
      be not true, and he made no assertion that it was, his strong arm will
      avail us little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely if ever honesty beamed from a man&rsquo;s face it was from Armstrong&rsquo;s.
      The Scots are trustworthy men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uneasy suspicion came into the sunken eyes of the King as he turned them
      on his Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you fear, De Courcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been studying the man these three days past. I accepted without
      question his assurances, and threw him off his guard. Cromwell loves an
      honest-looking envoy, and from what Armstrong said I am sure he saw
      Cromwell no farther away than Northampton. He was very ready with his
      account of his own country people, but he told us nothing about the
      marvellous luck that brought him safely through a hostile land, which we
      know to our cost is admirably patrolled. There is young Rudby, gone this
      month and more to Edinburgh, and yet no word of him. And this stranger
      expects us to believe he came over the same ground unscathed and
      unquestioned in less than a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! O God! In whom can I place dependence,&rdquo; cried the tortured King,
      burying his head in his hands. Then he raised it and said with a trace of
      anger in his voice: &ldquo;If you knew this man to be a traitor, or an emissary
      of that rebel, why did you bring him into our presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not be sure of him, your Majesty, and there was always a chance
      that he was loyal and might get through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To raise my hopes like this and then dash them to the ground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, your Majesty, if you will pardon me. Do you place importance on
      this commission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The utmost importance. I know Traquair, and he will raise all Scotland
      for me if this commission reach him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will mak siccar, as a famous Scot once said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, De Courcy, that was said when a treacherous murder was intended. How
      will you make sure that Armstrong is honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should trouble no more about Armstrong, but if you will issue a
      duplicate of that commission I will guarantee that it reaches the hand of
      Traquair. I am a Frenchman, and a subject of the French king. I carry my
      passport to that effect. Even if I am stopped, I shall resist search on
      the ground of my nationality, and Cromwell is too greatly in awe of the
      power of France to risk its might being thrown in the scale against him.
      Indeed I doubt if I could offer a greater service to your Majesty than to
      be captured and appeal to Louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s face cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not stop Armstrong then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly not. If his copy gets into Cromwell&rsquo;s hands he may slacken his
      alertness and not be on the outlook for a duplicate. As I said before,
      there is a chance the Scot plays fair, but two commissions in the hands of
      Traquair will do no harm, and we mak siccar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in the right, and your advice is always of the best. How soon
      will you be ready to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very moment, your Majesty. There is no time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! True! True!&rdquo; Then to the secretary, &ldquo;Write another. Do you remember
      the names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty. I have them here on a slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy bade farewell to the King, who urged him to return as soon as
      horse could bring him, and went to his room to prepare for his journey,
      the duplicate commission following him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong strode to the inn, sped up the stair, and knocked at the door by
      the landing. Frances herself opened it, the determination on her face to
      refuse admission to any other than he melting into a welcome as she
      greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My girl, are you ready for the North?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, ready and eager. Have you seen the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, and his royal signature rests over my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The joy fled from the girl&rsquo;s face; she turned and walked with uncertain
      steps to the table. A hope had arisen that the venomous De Courcy would
      have prejudiced the King against the young man, and that the hateful task
      of robbery would not be required. But now this last refuge had failed. She
      strove not to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would rather not go until to-morrow,&rdquo; said Armstrong, &ldquo;I can wait,
      but, lassie, I&rsquo;m desperate anxious to leave Oxford as soon as possible. We
      will not travel farther than Banbury to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; she replied with forced firmness.

      CHAPTER I.&mdash;TENSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he road between
      Oxford and Banbury is the most peaceful of thoroughfares, laid with
      reasonable directness, gently undulating in parts, passing through quiet
      villages and a sweet country, mildly beautiful, yet to the mind of Frances
      Wentworth this innocent highway ever remained, as it were, a section of
      the broad path to perdition. In after life she never thought of it but
      with a creepy sensation of horror. She was compelled to traverse ground
      that was the scene of her lover&rsquo;s proposal, with the lover whom she had
      rejected. The futile incident, she thought, must be constantly recurring
      to his mind as it recurred to hers, now that they rode side by side once
      more along this ill-favoured highway. Even though he sat silent on his
      horse, more gloomy than was his wont, she guessed what he was thinking. In
      Oxford, God be thanked they were quit of it! a grave danger was left
      behind, but in Banbury awaited the cruel test. There the stage was
      prepared for her enactment of the part of a midnight Lady Macbeth, to rob
      the sleeping Scot, not of his life, but of that for which he had staked
      his life and for the preservation of which he stood willing to give up his
      life. Heretofore she had lulled an accusing conscience by telling it that
      her deed would preserve his life, but now that she knew him better, such
      solace was withdrawn from her. There was little likelihood that he would
      travel far beyond Banbury without discovering his loss, and, while he
      would never suspect her of the theft, it needed no seer to predict his
      course of action. He would return instantly to Oxford, and when next he
      was baffled it would be by Cromwell&rsquo;s troopers, and then, she had the
      General&rsquo;s own word for it, came condemnation and the noose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despondency seemed to be the portion of William Armstrong as well as of
      his fair companion. She surmised that he was pondering on the events which
      had happened when their faces were set south over this course, and in part
      she was right; but the thoughts which rankled in his mind were those
      implanted by De Courcy, and the wily Frenchman had been accurate enough in
      his belief that the young man&rsquo;s pleasure in the northward journey would be
      spoiled. He could not bring himself to ask any explanation from the girl,
      nor even tell her what De Courcy had said, for he saw that already a
      weight of woe oppressed her, and to that burden he would not add a
      pressure of the slightest word. He possessed a supreme confidence in her,
      and only feared that she had loved this runagate once, and that some
      remnant of this long-ago affection still remained. Her own words before
      they reached Oxford, her own action during the encounter fronting &ldquo;The
      Crown&rdquo; inn, disturbed him far more than the insinuations of the Frenchman.
      He strove to rid himself of these thoughts, but they were very intrusive
      and persistent. At last with an effort he roused himself and cried with
      feigned hilarity,&mdash;&ldquo;Frances, we travel like two mutes. The influence
      of saddened Oxford is still upon us both. We are long out of sight of the
      town, so let us be done with all remembrance of it. The meeting with the
      King this morning has stirred me up to a great pity for him, but vexed
      meditations on his case are no help either to him or to us. The spur is
      the only weapon I can wield for him now, so let us gallop and cry, &lsquo;God
      save the King!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that they raced together for a time and were the better of it. He had
      become almost cheerful again when the spires of Banbury came into view,
      and thanked fortune that the first stage of their march was safely over.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Old John and his pack horse both ready for the road again, and
      Armstrong was plainly loath to let such a fine evening slip by without
      further progress, but Frances seemed so wan and worn that he had not the
      heart to propose a more distant stopping-place, and, with a sigh, he put
      up his horse for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was gone the innkeeper came furtively to Frances, and, after
      seeing the pass, led her to the prepared room and showed her the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much against her will, Armstrong insisted upon her coming to supper with
      him, although she protested she had no appetite, and indeed sat opposite
      him most forlorn and could not touch a morsel. In vain he urged her to
      eat, but she shook her head, avoiding his glance and keeping her eyes
      downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My girl,&rdquo; he said anxiously, &ldquo;you are completely tired. I see that you
      are on the point of being ill if better care is not taken. Rest here a few
      days, I beg of you. Eager as I am to be forward, I will stay if you wish
      to have me near you. Or I will push on and come back for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be well enough in the morning, most like. I am tired to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dispirited too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and dispirited. You will excuse me, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances rose to her feet, but seemed so faint that she leaned against the
      table for support. He was by her side at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet lass, I am so sorry for you. Tell me what I can do for you, and
      on my soul, my life is yours if you require it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! God grant you take no hurt for my sake.&rdquo;

    <p>
      He slipped his arm about her waist and would have drawn her toward him,
      but with more strength than he had expected her to possess she held away.
      His great love for her almost overcame him, and all the prudence he had
      gathered was scattered suddenly to the winds. &ldquo;Dear, dear lass, one touch
      of our lips and see if all doubts do not dissolve before the contact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she wrenched herself free, and would have escaped but that he sprang
      forward and caught her by the wrists, a grip she was to remember later in
      the night. In spite of this prisoning, her hands were raised to the sides
      of her face, and a look of such terror shot from her eyes that he feared
      some madness had come upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that! Not that!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;The kiss of Judas! It would kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms dropped paralyzed to his sides, and he stepped back a pace,
      amazed at the expression she had used and the terror of her utterance.
      Next instant he was alone, and the closed door between them. Still he
      stood where she had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kiss of Judas!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The kiss of Judas! She loves him,
      thinks me his friend, trying to take Judas advantage of him because we are
      alone together. De Courcy spoke truth. Wae is me, she loves him, and I,
      blind fool&mdash;&mdash;Oh God! pity that poor girl, and this insanity of
      passion wasted on so rank a cur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances fled to her room and threw herself on the bed in an agony of
      tears. This storm subsided into a gentle rain of subdued weeping, and
      finally ceased as she heard the heavy tramp of riding-boots in the
      adjoining room. She sat up in the darkness, listening intently. He closed
      the wooden shutters of the window, shaking them to be sure that their
      fastenings were secure. Then the bolts of the outer door were thrust in
      their places, but, this apparently failing to satisfy the doubts of the
      inmate, there was a sound of some heavy article of furniture being dragged
      across the room; then the tramping ceased and all was still. She sat there
      thinking of nothing; her mind seemed to be dulled by the ordeal awaiting
      her and the fear of it, but there was no thought of turning back or trying
      to avoid it. Dimly she was sorry for herself and for him, sleeping in his
      fancied security, yet in a set trap; but on her action this night depended
      her brother&rsquo;s life, and that outweighed all other considerations, even if
      her brain were alert enough to cast them in the opposite scales. Unheeding
      she had heard the clock in a neighbouring tower toll the hour; now it
      struck again and she counted the notes. Eleven! It was still too early.
      People slept heavier as the night wore on. She thought of their journey;
      of the halt at York; of their talk in the niche in the hotel of the
      Templars; of various incidents along the road; the march past of
      Cromwell&rsquo;s troopers, four and four, all looking straight ahead, and as she
      remembered them they seemed to be passing her now; passing, passing,
      passing; then Cromwell stopped and smote his steel breastplate with
      resounding clang. She lifted her head with a start, and the clang of the
      breastplate changed to the toll of the bell in the tower. Heavens, she had
      been asleep; her brother&rsquo;s life hanging on her drooping eyelids! One, two,
      three four, five, six, seven! It must be midnight, and the first five
      strokes had been on Cromwell&rsquo;s breastplate. She roused herself and
      attempted to take off her shoes, but her hands were trembling so she was
      forced to desist. She sat up again, telling herself it was better to wait
      until all effect of the long chiming had ceased, for the striking of
      twelve sometimes disturbed or awakened the soundest sleeper. The clock
      tower seemed dangerously near, as if it were approaching her hour by hour.
      At last the shoes came off, and in stockinged feet she stood by the secret
      door, waiting till the frightfully rapid beating of her heart should
      moderate. It threatened to choke her. Then she slid back the bar and drew
      open the door, all so smoothly oiled that there was not the whisper of a
      creak. She tiptoed into the cavern of blackness and silence, holding her
      spread hands in front of her, moving slowly with the utmost caution, step
      by step. In her mind she had estimated, from her earlier survey of the
      room, that nine steps would take her to the bed; now she realized she had
      taken a dozen and yet had not come to it. She stood bewildered and
      listened. The helplessness of a person in the pitch dark thrilled her with
      a new fear, upsetting all her calculations. The panic of pulsation in her
      throat and in her ears at first rendered any attempt at listening futile;
      but at last she heard his regular breathing, as peaceful as that of an
      infant, and it came from the other side of the room. For a moment this
      terrified her, and she wondered if she were really awake, or in the mazes
      of some baffling nightmare; but the solution came to her mind and quieted
      the growing agitation. It had been his bed that he dragged across the
      floor, and he was now sleeping against the outside door. And all his
      preparations were as naught, because of this midnight spectre, moving upon
      him! She changed her direction and, with her former stealth, came
      ghost-like to the edge of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His doublet was open at the throat; that was so much to the good. Like a
      snowflake in its coldness and its lightness, her hand stole down
      underneath his vest, fluttered by the slow, steady, subdued beating of his
      heart, running no such wild race as her own at that moment. It seemed
      incredible that at last her fingers closed on the parchment; but there it
      lay, and gently she drew it forth. Was the robbery to be so easily
      accomplished after all? Ah, she had congratulated herself too soon. It
      stuck fast; either the silken cord that bound it was caught, or the
      document was secured to the vest,&mdash;a contingency she had never
      thought of, and yet what more natural? Twice she tugged it gently, then a
      third time more strenuously, when it came unexpectedly away and her
      knuckles struck the sleeper under the chin. Instantly, like the snap of a
      steel trap, his fingers closed upon her wrist, and his voice rang out as
      wideawake and clear as ever he had spoken to her: &ldquo;Frances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the racing heart stopped dead. Lucky for her that at this supreme
      moment all action was impossible, and that she was stricken into frozen
      marble. She imagined he was awake and knew her, and then the cold horror
      of her situation numbed thought at its source.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances!&rdquo; The voice came more sleepily this time, and he repeated thrice
      very rapidly, &ldquo;Frances, Frances, Frances!&rdquo; Feebly her heart had taken up
      its work again. She was not to die as she had feared. Sodden with
      drowsiness, his voice rambled on, and came to an indefinite conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, you are in danger. We must get out of Oxford. Everything,
      every&mdash;&mdash;your safety, my dear. The King&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then the
      words became indistinct and died away; but alas! the grip of iron remained
      on her wrist. For a long time she stood there motionless; then tried to
      disengage his fingers gently; but at the first movement the grasp
      tightened again. One o&rsquo;clock struck. He slept so silently that it began to
      appear to her agitated brain that she was a prisoner of the dead. She came
      near to sinking from very weariness. Two o&rsquo;clock tolled from the tower.
      Sometimes she fancied she slept standing there, but her five jailors did
      not sleep. She kept wondering in which direction lay the open door, for at
      times the room seemed to swim around her, thus disturbing all sense of
      locality. She almost laughed aloud when she thought of herself free, but
      groping helplessly for the open door, failing to find it, and she
      shuddered that even the remembrance of laughter should come to her at such
      a time; surely a sign of approaching frenzy. Then it seemed the fingers
      loosened; but hand and wrist had lost all feeling, and she could not be
      sure. She tottered and nearly fell; when she stood upright again she was
      free; he muttering to himself, and his hand slashing undirected on the
      mattress, as if it missed something it sought drunkenly to recover. The
      girl could scarce repress a cry of joy at her release. She moved eagerly
      in the path that should lead her to the door, but, hurrying too much, came
      upon his jack-boots on the floor, and fell helplessly, so overwrought that
      even when her feet touched them she could not draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? Who&rsquo;s in this room?&rdquo; cried Armstrong. She was standing
      again, fully expecting to hear his feet on the floor; but the bell struck
      three, and he counted dreamily, and all was still again. When she reached
      her room, she closed and barred the door as silently as she had opened it.
      The tension relaxed, she felt she was going to swoon. Blindly she groped
      for her shoes, murmuring, &ldquo;O God! not yet,&mdash;not yet. Give me a moment
      more.&rdquo; Finding her foot-gear at last, she dared not wait to put them on,
      but stole softly down the stair, steadying herself against the wall. The
      cool air outside struck her like the blessing of God, and soothed her
      whirling head. She heard a horse champing his bit, then a whisper came out
      of the darkness: &ldquo;Is that you at last, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, sinking on the doorstep, and leaning her head against the
      lintel, the cold stone grateful to her hot forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not hurt, madam?&rdquo; inquired the man anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she gasped; then, with an eldritch little laugh, &ldquo;I want to put
      on my shoes, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;ACQUITTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ither the moon had
      set, or lay behind a cloud; for the night was very dark, with no trace of
      morning yet visible in the east. Frances buckled on her shoes and stood
      up. The innkeeper led forward his horse, and would doubtless have
      proffered his assistance, but when she spoke he learned she was already in
      the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set me on the road to Broughton, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word for to-night is &lsquo;Broughton,&rsquo;&rdquo; he whispered, then took the horse
      by the bridle and led him down the street. The girl became aware that the
      town was alive with unseen men; for at every corner the innkeeper breathed
      the word &ldquo;Broughton&rdquo; to some one who had challenged his progress. She
      realized then that Cromwell had surrounded Armstrong with a ring of flesh;
      a living clasp, as her own wrist had been circled earlier in the night. At
      last they came suddenly from the shadow of the houses into the open
      country, and the night seemed lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight on for about a league,&rdquo; said the innkeeper. &ldquo;You will be
      challenged by a sentinel before you reach the castle, and he will lead you
      there. Remember that the word, going and returning, is &lsquo;Broughton.&rsquo; Do not
      forget, I beg of you, to tell the General that all preparations were made
      to your liking;&rdquo; and with that the honest man let go the rein, smote the
      horse on the flank, and bade her goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself the girl experienced that exhilaration which comes of
      the morning air, the freshness of the country, and the movement of a
      spirited horse. She breathed deeply and felt as one brought newly to life
      again. If it were not for her upbraiding conscience and her distress of
      mind, she could have sung for the joy of living. But the Biblical phrase,
      &ldquo;A thief in the night,&rdquo; haunted her, and brought a choking sensation to
      her throat. Once or twice she wavered and almost turned back; for there
      was still time to undo; but reflection showed her the uselessness of
      retreat, as the town she had left was man-environed, and, until Cromwell
      gave the word of release, Armstrong could no more reach its outer boundary
      than she could have escaped when his fingers closed upon her wrist. Her
      sacrifice must be complete, or all she loved were involved in common ruin.
      So, with the phrase ringing in her ears, &ldquo;Thief in the night, Thief in the
      night,&rdquo; through the night she galloped, until her horse suddenly placed
      his fore feet rigid, and came to a stop so abrupt that the shock nearly
      unseated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo; came the sharp challenge from under the trees that
      overshadowed the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broughton,&rdquo; she answered automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the woman from Banbury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Broughton Castle. I will lead your horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended a slight depression and came to a drawbridge, passed under
      an arch in the wall, then across a level lawn, on the further edge of
      which stood the broad eastern front of the castle with its numerous
      mullioned windows, a mysterious half-light in the horizon playing on the
      blank panes, which recalled the staring, open eyes of a blind man. The
      house seemed high and sombre, with no sign of light within. The sentinel
      beat against the door, and it was opened at once. Muffled as had been the
      knocking on the oak, it awoke the alert General; for when Frances had
      dismounted and followed her guide into the ample hall, Cromwell stood at
      the head of the stair, a candle in his hand. Less mindful of his comfort
      than Armstrong, he had evidently slept in his boots; and, as Frances
      looked up at him, his strong face seemed older than when she last saw him,
      although but a few days had passed. The swaying flame of the candle, held
      on a level with his head, made the shadows come and go on his rugged
      features, and emphasized the deep furrows in his face. His hair was
      tousled, and he had the unkempt appearance of a man who had slept in his
      clothes. But his eyes burned down upon her, as if their fire had never
      been extinguished even for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up,&rdquo; he commanded, and, as she ascended the stair, cried
      impatiently, &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the King&rsquo;s commission,&rdquo; she said quietly, presenting the
      document to him. He took it without a word, turned, and entered the room;
      she following him. He placed the candle on a table, did not take the time
      to untie the silken cord that bound the royal communication, but ripped it
      asunder, and spread open the crinkling parchment, holding it up to the
      light. He read it through to the end, then cast it contemptuously on the
      table, muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles Rex! A wreck you have made of life and opportunity and country.&rdquo;
       Then to the girl. &ldquo;Wench, you have done well. Would you were a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pardon for my brother, sir, if it please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ready, and the commission as captain also. You see I trusted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did another, and through his faith he now lies undone in Banbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not killed him?&rdquo; cried Cromwell sharply, looking with something
      almost like alarm at the uncanny apparition. All beauty had deserted her,
      and her face seemed pinched and small, white as the parchment on the
      table, and rendered unearthly in its hue by the mass of cavern-black hair
      that surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed him? No! But I have killed his faith in woman, cozened him, lied
      to him, robbed him, to buy from you, with the name of your Maker on your
      lips, a life that you know was not forfeited, but which you had the power
      to destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, yes, yes! I remember your tongue of old; but it may wag harmless
      now, for all of me. His life <i>was</i> forfeited; aye, and this Scot&rsquo;s as
      well. But no matter now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw before her the pardon for her brother and his commission as
      captain, then strode out of the room to the head of the stair again, and
      she heard his strenuous voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hobson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride at once to the commandant at Banbury. Tell him the Scot goes free.
      Tell him to send word north, and see that he is not molested; but should
      he turn in his tracks and attempt to reach Oxford again, hold him and send
      word to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send up a stoup of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited at the stair-head until the wine was brought, then took it into
      the room and placed it on the table before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, <i>drink</i>,&rdquo; he shouted in a voice so harsh that it made her
      tremble. She lifted the flagon to her lips, and barely sipped the liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; he roared, bringing his clenched fist down on the oaken table
      with a force that made the very room quiver. The word had all the brutal
      coarseness of an oath, and it beat down her weak resolution as the storm
      levels the sapling. She drank deep, then let the flagon drop, raised her
      hands to her face, and burst into a helpless wail of weeping. Cromwell&rsquo;s
      face softened, now that he was obeyed, and he looked at this
      passion-swayed human flower with the air of a puzzled man. Then his huge
      hand patted her heaving shoulders with some attempt at gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he said, in tones not unkindly, &ldquo;do not distress yourself.
      You are a brave wench, and the wine will do you good, though you take it
      as it were a leech&rsquo;s draught. I meant no harshness toward you; indeed you
      remind me of my own daughter, who thinks her father criminal, and will
      shout for this foolish King in my very ears. Aye, and is as ready with the
      tears as any one of you, to the bewilderment of straight-going folk. I
      have a younger daughter who is your namesake, and I love her well. You
      will rest here in Broughton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; sobbed the girl. &ldquo;I must at once to Banbury. Give me, I beg of
      you, a pass for my servant to the county of Durham. I would send him on to
      my brother without delay, so that your release may reach him as soon as
      may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you? You do not purpose travelling further with this Scot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done the crime; I must not shirk the punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, this is woman&rsquo;s talk. There is no punishment. He dare not place
      a hand on you. You may have an escort of twenty men, who will see you safe
      for all the Scots that ever depredated their neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl dolefully shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My punishment will take the shape of no harshness from him. It will come
      to me when I see his face, knowing me a thief in the night. This
      punishment is with me now and will be with me always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman, I do not like your bearing, touching what you have done. You did
      your duty by your country, God aiding you. Neither do I like your attitude
      towards this meddler in affairs of state. What is your relationship to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely that of the highwayman toward his victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharp words again; hollow-sounding brass, and the tinkling of cymbals. I
      ask you if there has been any foolish talk between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If &rsquo;t were so, &rsquo;t is not an affair of state, and I shall
      follow the example of General Cromwell and allow no meddlers in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wry smile came to the lips of her questioner, and he remarked drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you the wine would do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by the table and wrote the pass for John, the servant, tying
      the three papers together with the discarded silk cord that had wrapped
      the parchment of the King. Giving her the package, he accompanied her to
      the head of the stair, and stood there while she descended. He did not
      offer her his hand, nor say any word of farewell. They needed now no
      candle, for the early daylight was coming through the broad eastern
      window. Half way down the stair she turned, and looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The innkeeper at Banbury did everything that was possible for a man to do
      in aiding me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell made no comment on this piece of information, standing there as
      if he were a carven, wooden statue, part of the decoration of the hall.
      She completed her descent, passed outside without looking back, and
      mounted the horse which a soldier was holding for her. The birds were
      twittering in the trees, and the still water of the moat lay like molten
      silver in the new light. She rode up the aclivity, then galloped for
      Banbury, reaching the town before anyone was astir. The streets were
      entirely deserted, Cromwell&rsquo;s command having cleared them, and the
      invisible guards of a few hours before, whom the magic pass-word stilled,
      seemed as nonexistent as if they had been phantoms of a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleepy innkeeper received the horse, and she crept up the stair of Old
      John&rsquo;s room and knocked upon it until he responded. She gave him his pass,
      and the two documents for her brother, and told him to set off for Durham
      as soon as he got his breakfast, making what haste he could to Warburton
      Park, he was to tell her brother that she was well and would follow
      shortly. Then she went to her own room, threw herself on the bed, dressed
      as she was, and, certain she would never enjoy innocent sleep again, slept
      instantly.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;ENLIGHTENMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen William
      Armstrong awoke, he thought he had overslept himself, for the trampling of
      horses sounded in the paved courtyard below. The one window of his room,
      over which he had drawn and fastened heavy wooden shutters the night
      before, let in a thread of light which showed him a new day had come, and
      the activity in the yard made him fear he had lain longer abed than was
      his custom. He was the more convinced of this in that he remembered hazily
      the clattering hoofs of a horse some time before, and then later, another
      being led out; now there appeared to be a third, and the hum of talk came
      up to him. His window overlooked the stable yard, and he recognized the
      mumble of the hostler who had assisted him yesterday. He lay still, half
      drowsed, the mattress most alluring to him, when suddenly he was startled
      wide awake by a voice he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I turn to the left for Broughton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; muttered the hostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong leaped from his bed, placed his eye at the chink in the
      shutters, and peered down into the stable yard. The voice had not misled
      him. De Courcy, sitting on a horse, was just gathering up the reins and
      departing. The Scot lost no time in pulling on his boots, pushing aside
      the bed, unbolting the door, and making his way down the stair. What did
      this gaily plumaged bird of ill-omen here in the country of the
      Parliament, when his place was beside the King? Was there treachery afoot?
      It looked like it. Once outside, he saw it was still early, with the sun
      scarcely risen. He accosted the yawning hostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man you were directing to Broughton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don &rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he arrive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, sir, after dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he stop in this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I thought he was a friend of yours, for he knew your horse when
      I was putting up his own. He asked if you were here, and I told him you
      were in the room over the yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Broughton; a hamlet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a castle, sir. Lord Say&rsquo;s castle, about three miles from here.
      General Cromwell is there now; it is his headquarters in this district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood stock still, his eyes gazing into vacancy. What
      traffic had this King&rsquo;s Chamberlain with Cromwell? How dared he come
      within the Parliamentary lines, undisguised, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;Like
      inspiration the whole situation flashed upon him. De Courcy knew the
      burden he carried, and had seen where it was placed. He was on his way to
      sell his secret and set the troops on the track of the messenger. He must
      be off at once and outride the traitor. Before De Courcy had gone his
      three miles, he would have traversed a dozen, and from then on it would be
      a race to the Scottish border.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my horse fed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get him out at once. I will arouse the others.&rdquo; He took three steps
      toward the inn, then stopped as if shot, his hand clutching his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, he&rsquo;s got the thing itself. Robbed, as I&rsquo;m a sinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the disturbance in the night stood out clear in his memory, but he
      wasted not a thought over it. In upon the astonished hostler he swept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the saddle, fellow. Spring up behind me and show me the road
      to Broughton. Up, I say, the horse can carry a dozen like us. Here are two
      gold pieces for you; guidance and a still tongue in your head is what I
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong grasped the two pistols from the holsters, flung the hesitating
      hostler upon the animal&rsquo;s back, and leaped up in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way, which way, which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight down the street, sir,&rdquo; gasped the terrified man, clasping the
      rider round the waist. &ldquo;Now to the right, sir, and next to the left.
      That&rsquo;s it, sir. Up the hill. Ah, there&rsquo;s your man, jogging on ahead,
      leisurely enough, if it&rsquo;s him you seek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Slip off; I can &rsquo;t stop. God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hostler rolled in a heap along the ditch, staggered to his feet,
      feeling his limbs for broken bones, thinking his gold pieces hardly earned
      in such usage; then, satisfying himself that the damage was not great,
      hobbled back to Banbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy, riding easily, as the man had said, wholly unsuspicious of
      pursuit or any reason for it, had disappeared into a hollow when Bruce,
      like a thunder-cloud, came over the crest, and charged down upon him with
      the irresistible force of a troop of dragoons. The Frenchman, hearing too
      late the rumble of the hoofs, partly turned his horse across the road, the
      worst movement he could have made, for Bruce, with a war-neigh, came
      breast on, maddened with the delight of battle, and whirled opposing horse
      and rider over and over like a cart-wheel flung along the road from the
      hand of a smith. De Courcy lay partly stunned at the roadside, while his
      frightened steed staggered to its feet, leaped the hedge with a scream of
      fear, and scampered across the field to its farthest extremity. Armstrong
      swung himself to the ground with a quieting word to Bruce, who stood
      still, panting, and watching every movement of his master. A pistol in
      each hand, Armstrong strode over to his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You halter-dog, traitor, and scullion, give me the King&rsquo;s commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you have killed me,&rdquo; moaned De Courcy faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bribed thief, the rope is your end. You&rsquo;ll take no scath through
      honourable warfare. Disgorge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy, vaguely wondering how the other knew he carried it, drew from
      within his torn doublet the second commission signed by the King, and
      handed it up with a groan to the conqueror. As it was an exact duplicate
      of the one he had lost, even to the silken cord, the honest Scot had not
      the slightest doubt he had come by his own again, and the prone man was
      equally convinced that some one had betrayed to Armstrong his secret
      mission, yet for the life of him could not guess how this were possible.
      The young man placed the document where its predecessor had been, then
      said to his victim: &ldquo;Had I a rope and a hangman with me, you would end
      your life on yonder tree. When first I learned your character, you were in
      some danger from my sword; a moment since you stood in jeopardy from my
      pistols; beware our third meeting, for if you cross my path again, I will
      strangle you with my naked hands, if need be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Courcy made no reply. He realized that this was not a time for
      controversy. A standing man well armed has manifest advantages over an
      enemy bruised and on the ground, and some thought of this came to the mind
      of the generous victor now that his anger was cooling. He felt that it was
      rather undignified to threaten a helpless adversary, and if he were a
      traitor to the King, let the King deal with him. So, whistling to his
      horse, he sprang on his back, and rode to Banbury at a slower pace than he
      had traversed the same highway some minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostler made grievous pretence that he had been all but murdered by
      his fall, and Armstrong examined him minutely, as he would have done with
      a favourite horse, pronouncing him none the worse for his tumbling, but
      rather the better, as he was now more supple than he had been for years.
      He rewarded the man lavishly, nevertheless, and gave him the recipe for a
      liniment good for man and beast, should after-complications ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; whined the man, &ldquo;that you did not treat the gentleman you
      were in such haste to meet, as roughly as you did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much the same,&rdquo; cried Armstrong, with a laugh, &ldquo;but you are the
      better off, because I left him neither gold nor medicine; taking from him
      rather than bestowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is <i>that</i> your game?&rdquo; whispered the hostler, a glint of
      admiration lighting up his eyes. &ldquo;Dang me, if I did not take thee for a
      gentleman of the road when first I clapped eyes on thee. Be sure I&rsquo;ll say
      naught, for I&rsquo;ve cut a purse myself in younger days. Those times were
      better than now. There&rsquo;s too many soldiers and too few gentlemen with fat
      purses travelling the roads nowadays for our trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again William laughed, and shook hands with the old man, as one highwayman
      in a good way of business might condescend to another less prosperous, and
      the veteran hostler boasted of his intimacy with a noted freebooter for
      the rest of his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rub down my horse well, while I am at breakfast,&rdquo; said Armstrong, and,
      receiving every assurance that the beast of so excellent a highwayman
      should get earnest attention, he went to the inn and there found Frances
      awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was standing by the window, which was low and long, with a
      valance of crimpled spotted muslin running athwart the lower half of it. A
      bench was fixed beneath the window, and on this bench the girl had rested
      a knee, while her cheek was placed against the diamond panes. The light
      struck her face and illuminated it strongly, and she stood so still that
      she seemed to form part of a tableau which might have been entitled
      &ldquo;Watching.&rdquo; On the table placed in the centre of the room, breakfast was
      spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a jubilant man who disturbed this quiet picture by his abrupt
      in-coming. The early morning gallop, the excitement of contest, the flush
      of victory, all had their effect on his bearing, and he came in with the
      mien of a Saxon prince, his yellow hair almost touching the beams of the
      low ceiling. The two formed a striking contrast when the embodiment of
      elation approached the embodiment of dejection. There was a new
      furtiveness in the brief glance she cast upon him, and after her first
      startled cognizance she looked beyond him, on either side of him, over his
      head, or at his feet, but never turned her eyes full upon him as of yore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my girl,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have not slept well. I can see that at once.
      This will never do; never do at all. But you are certainly looking better
      this morning than you did last night. Is that not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking very well,&rdquo; she said, avoiding his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ve had a morning gallop already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! With the ride to Scotland still before you. Is not a merciful man
      merciful to his horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should be, but I may say this for Bruce; he enjoyed the ride quite as
      much as I did. And now I am ravenous for breakfast, and eager for the road
      again.&rdquo; He tinkled a little hand-bell that rested on the table. &ldquo;We have
      another splendid day for it. The sunrise this morning was positively
      inspiring. Come, lass, and sit you down. We must get the roses back into
      those cheeks, and I think the ride to-day will do it; for we will be
      nearing the North, ever nearing the North, and you are just like me, you
      are yearning for the Northland, where all the men are brave and all the
      women fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair and false, perhaps you would add. That was your phrase, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William laughed heartily, drawing in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about our Stuarts, not about our ladies. They are ever leal and
      true. And indeed many of them are dark as well as fair, and they are the
      best. Dark hair, fair face, and a loyal heart; there is a combination to
      cherish when God is good to a man and allows him to meet it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant had now answered the tinkling bell, and Frances was too busy
      acting the housewife to make any comment on his enthusiastic description
      of what was to be found in the North. Her pale cheeks reddened as he
      spoke, and he took this for a promising sign. She was convinced that he
      had as yet no knowledge of his loss, and wondered when and where such
      knowledge would come to him. She hoped the enlightenment would be delayed
      until they were near the Scottish line or across it. Then she must tell
      him the truth at whatever cost to herself, and persuade him, if she could,
      not to return. When she made her confession, she would be in a position to
      relate all Cromwell had said to her; show him that the General had given
      orders which would block any backward move, and reveal his determination
      to hang the Scot should he entangle himself further with English politics.
      Yet she had the gravest doubts that these dangers would influence him. She
      knew him well enough to be aware that his own personal safety weighed but
      lightly with him, and the very opposition would determine him to try
      conclusions with it, unabashed by the overwhelming odds against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections troubled her until the time they were on their horses
      once more, when Armstrong interrupted them by crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s old John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent him on ahead long since,&rdquo; replied Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. We shall soon overtake him. Good bye, pirate!&rdquo; he cried to the
      grinning hostler. &ldquo;May I meet you on the road next time with a thousand
      pounds on you, and if you whisper &lsquo;Banbury&rsquo; to me, I will not lift a penny
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to you and your fair lady, sir,&rdquo; replied the enriched old man,
      raising his cap in salute. He wished more travellers like the brawny Scot
      came that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call the poor man a pirate?&rdquo; asked Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re comrades!&rdquo; laughed Armstrong. &ldquo;He thinks me a capable, prompt,
      and energetic highwayman, and admitted on the quiet that he had cut a
      purse himself upon occasion in the days of his youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why does he think you a highwayman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that would be telling. Suppose it is because I escort the fairest
      lady in the land? The sex have ever favoured the biggest rascals. No, I
      shall not incriminate myself, but shall maintain my pose of the amiable
      hypocrite. Here rides Will Armstrong, the honest man, if you take his own
      word for it. But the hostler knows better. He sees secret comings and
      goings, and draws his sage conclusions. Banbury! O Lord, I shall never
      forget Banbury! It is a place of mystery, the keeper of dark secrets and
      sudden rides, of midnight theft and of treachery. Ask the Broughton road,
      where Cromwell lies, to reveal what it knows. Things happen along that
      track which the King knows nothing of, and his royal signature takes
      journeys that he never counted upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s pity! What do you mean?&rdquo; moaned the girl, whitening to the lips.
      He laughed joyously, but checked himself when he saw the terrifying effect
      of his words on his companion. They were now clear of Banbury and trotting
      along the Coventry road. Their departure had met with no opposition, and
      they had seen not even a single soldier. The open country lay before them,
      the turrets of the town sinking in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My foolish words have frightened you. Forget them! I am accumulating
      experiences that will interest you to hear when the time comes for the
      telling of them, but of one thing I am assured, the good Lord stands by
      his own, and He has shielded me since yesterday morning broke. Come,
      Frances, let us gallop. That, and a trust in the Lord, will remedy all the
      ills of man or woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was glad of the respite and they set off at full speed, nevertheless
      her mind was sorely troubled. &ldquo;What did he know, what did he know?&rdquo; beat
      through her brain in unison with the clatter of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs. It was
      not possible that chance had brought him thus to the very centre of her
      guilty secret. Cromwell, treachery, midnight stealth, the Broughton road,
      these words and phrases tortured her. Was this, then, the line of his
      revenge? Did he know all, and did he purpose to keep her thus in suspense,
      hinting, soothing her fears, then reviving them, making her black crime
      the subject of jest and laughter? She cast a glance over her shoulder.
      Banbury had disappeared; they were alone, flying over the land. The doubt
      was unbearable; she would endure it no longer. Impetuously she reined her
      horse to a stand. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, and at the word her own horse and
      Bruce halted and stood. The young man turned with alarm to her agitated
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by your talk of Broughton and Cromwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is a secret! I did not intend to tell you until our journey was
      ended, when we could laugh over it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no laughing matter. I must know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All dangers are laughable once they are past. An unknown, unsuspected
      danger threatened me at Banbury. It is now past and done with, and the
      person who plotted against me can harm me no more. There are reasons why I
      do not wish to mention this person&rsquo;s name. Barring that, I may tell you
      now as well as another time, if you care to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know the person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! You knew the person long before I did. It was a person I
      trusted, but not know to be a traitor and a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some moments before Frances could speak, but at last she said very
      quietly, looking down at her horse&rsquo;s mane,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me the story, and I
      will tell you the name of the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You slept badly last night Did you hear anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;-I heard the clock strike the hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it strike three, but lay so locked in drowsiness that I knew not
      the Lord was calling to me. If the Seven Sleepers were melted into one, I
      would outsleep that one. Well, to get on, I was robbed in the night. It
      must have been at that hour, for I remember dimly some sort of
      disturbance. But Providence stood my friend. By the merest chance, it
      might seem, but not by chance as I believe, I saw the creature make for
      Broughton. &lsquo;So, here&rsquo;s for Broughton,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;on the bare back of
      Bruce, and see if my good pistols would win back what had been stolen from
      me.&rsquo; The Broughton road it was, and the pistols did the business.&rdquo; Saying
      this, he whisked from his pocket the King&rsquo;s commission, waving it
      triumphantly aloft. Her wide eyes drank in the amazing sight of it, slowly
      brimming with superstitious fear, and then she asked a duplicate of the
      question that had been asked of her a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you kill Cromwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell! I never saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom, then, did you wrench that parchment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the thief, of course. He never reached Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am going mad! Who is the thief, who is the thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Courcy, if you must know. Why does this trivial matter so disturb you?
      De Courcy followed us from Oxford last night, and was lodged at our inn.
      By some means he penetrated into my room, stole this from me, and I never
      missed it until I saw him ride for Broughton, and not even then, to tell
      the exact truth. But I remembered that he had seen me place this paper in
      the inside pocket of my vest, in the King&rsquo;s own presence, and then the
      whole plot came to me. Before he saw Broughton, Bruce and I were down upon
      him like a Highland storm on the Lowlands. &lsquo;My sword! you should have seen
      us! For a minute there was one whirligig of horse&rsquo;s legs and Frenchman,
      like a raree-show of acrobats struck by a whirlwind. If I had not been so
      angry I would have had the best laugh of my life,&rdquo;&mdash;and the genial
      William threw back his head and made the wood echo with his merriment at
      the recollection. But the girl was sober enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the King&rsquo;s commission,&rdquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not. Have you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but that&rsquo;s soon done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He untied the cord and unfolded the sheepskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned eagerly forward and scanned the writing, while Armstrong read
      it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he cried gleefully. &ldquo;Of course it is the commission. There are
      the names of Traquair, and all the rest, just as I gave them to the
      secretary, and there is &lsquo;Charles Rex&rsquo; in the King&rsquo;s own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a duplicate. Cromwell has the original. You never left De Courcy
      alive within a mile of Broughton Castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that very thing. Not as lively as I have seen him, yet alive
      nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ride, ride for the North. We have stood too long chattering here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time, Frances. There is no more hurry than ever there was;
      less, indeed, for it seems to me that Cromwell, for some reason, wants to
      come at this by fraud and not by force. But now that De Courcy&rsquo;s name is
      mentioned between us, I ask you what you know against him more than I have
      told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against him? I know everything against him. Would that you had killed
      him. He would sell his soul, if he has one. He robbed my dying father, and
      on the day of his death, when I was the only one in London who did not
      know he was executed, De Courcy lured me to his apartments at Whitehall
      under pretense of leading me to the King that I might plead for my
      father&rsquo;s life. There he attempted to entrap me, snapped in my hand the
      sword which I had clutched from the wall to defend myself, and I struck
      him twice in the face, and blinded him with his own false blood, and so
      escaped. Judge, then, my fear when I saw him there at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth! The truth! At last the truth!&rdquo; shouted Armstrong, as if a
      weight had fallen from his shoulders. &ldquo;The truth has a ring like honest
      steel, and cannot be mistaken when once you hear it. He lied to me about
      you in Oxford, and I called him liar, and would have proven it on him, but
      that he told me you were in danger. I should have killed the whelp this
      morning, but that he could not defend himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth! Yes, but only part of it. He did not rob you last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I robbed you. I stole into your room and robbed you. I carried the
      original of that document to Cromwell himself, and it is now in his hands.
      It was the price of my brother&rsquo;s life. My brother was set on your track by
      Cromwell, and, being wounded, I took up his task. Do you understand? That
      was my mission to Oxford. To delude you, to rob you, and I have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girl, you are distraught!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not. Every word I tell you is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are saying that to shield some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, William Armstrong! For two hours and more, last night, you held me
      by the wrist. There is the bracelet with which you presented me,&mdash;black
      proof of the black guilt I confess to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held her hand aloft, and the sleeve fell away from the white and
      rounded arm, marred only by the dark circles where his fingers had
      pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say I did that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If still you do not believe me, measure your fingers with the shadow
      they have cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached out her hand to him, and he took it in his left, stroking the
      bruised wrist with his right, but looking into her eyes all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, is it this secret that stood between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this <i>all</i> that stood between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! Is it not enough? All! It is a mountain of sin that bears me to the
      very ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear lass, did you not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you? It was from you, of all the world, I must conceal it until
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed very quietly, fondling her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, how little you know! What is quarreling King or rebellious
      country to me compared with you? No wonder my beating heart did not awaken
      me with your hand upon it, for it was co-conspirator with you, and wholly
      your own. Heaven mend my broken patriotism!&mdash;but if you had asked me,
      I would have ridden myself to Cromwell with the King&rsquo;s signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;&mdash;can you forgive me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you? You are the bravest lass in all the land,&rdquo;&mdash;and with
      that, before she was aware or could ward off his attack if she had wished
      to do so, he reached impulsively forward, caught her off her horse, and
      held her in his arms as if she were a child, kissing her wounded wrist,
      her eyes, her hair, her lips. &ldquo;And now, do you forgive <i>me</i>,
      Frances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, willingly, willingly! Trespass for trespass. &lsquo;As we forgive them that
      trespass against us.&rsquo; But set me on my horse again, I beg of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe you are here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease, cease, I beg of you! The moments are too precious for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious they are and most preciously employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, Will, I implore you. Do you not understand? You are jesting on the
      brink of the grave. De Courcy has crawled to Cromwell ere this, and that
      grim man is lighting the North against us. They are now on our track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way is clear. There is no one in sight, and we can outride them when
      they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are riding across country to intercept us. Oh, let not my arms hold
      you back for destruction. Cromwell himself told me he would hang you if he
      had to take you openly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dare not. Have no fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dares anything. You do not know that man, and your condemnation, this
      document, rests now on the heart it would still. Cromwell will move the
      world to tear it from you. If you love me as you say, let us to the North
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well he knew the truth of her warning, now that he understood the case,
      but was reluctant to let her go. The last appeal had its effect, and he
      placed her once more on her horse. Together they set off again, through a
      land that seemed silent and at peace; but it was only seeming.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;ENTANGLED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was some
      delay at Warwick, and the authorities proved reluctant to let them proceed
      farther with the journey. It was evident that the commandant had received
      instructions regarding the very pass they presented to him for their safe
      conduct, because he retired with it to the guard-house, where he remained
      for a time that seemed perilously long, and even when at last he came out
      with it he was plainly still suspicious, and in doubt regarding what
      action he should take. It was Frances who turned the scale in her own
      favour and that of her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this pass?&rdquo; the commandant asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Corbiton Manor, in the county of Durham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was given to me by General Cromwell&rsquo;s direction, and written almost in
      my own presence, I might say, or at least a few moments after I had been
      speaking with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went from Durham to Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have come from Oxford here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you travel through Banbury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stopped the night at Banbury; at &lsquo;The Banbury Arms&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopping there by the direction of General Cromwell himself,&rdquo; put in the
      girl, much to the surprise of William Armstrong. The officer looked up at
      her with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did the General give you such instructions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several days ago, at Northampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him at Northampton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I saw him again this morning before daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really. And where was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Broughton Castle, three miles west of Banbury. In my presence he told
      his aid to ride to Banbury, and send word North that this pass was to be
      honored. Has the commander at Banbury not obeyed his General&rsquo;s
      instructions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; admitted the officer, looking with admiration on the young
      woman who spoke so straightforwardly; &ldquo;but the communication came to me by
      way of Coventry, and it was somewhat vague. The messenger reached here but
      a scant half hour since, and he spoke of one person, not of two. May I ask
      your name?&rdquo; he continued to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Armstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, my orders are to pass William Armstrong, holding a permit
      from the General, but say nothing of a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is doubtless the messenger&rsquo;s mistake,&rdquo; said Frances confidently. &ldquo;My
      brother is, or was, up to this morning, Lieutenant Wentworth of the
      Parliamentary forces in Durham. This morning General Cromwell wrote out
      his commission as captain, and that I brought away with me from Broughton
      and sent it direct to Durham by my servant. But you may detain me if you
      wish, or send an escort with me back to the General. It will be a more
      serious matter if you detain Mr. Armstrong, who is a Scotsman, and whom
      the General has been at some pains to further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, madam, I shall detain neither of you. My only excuse is that the
      messenger was not as clear as he might have been, and you come so close on
      his heels. Besides, I have had disquieting news from Birmingham. There is
      a rising of some sort forward. Birmingham has already been smitten sore by
      the King&rsquo;s troops, so there is little fear that the citizens have risen in
      his favour, but I surmise that there has been some sort of Royalist
      outbreak elsewhere in the North. Something is afoot, for messengers have
      been galloping through Alcaster to the east of us for Birmingham. You
      heard nothing of that further south?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Armstrong, who nevertheless had a shrewd suspicion where the
      trouble lay. &ldquo;If there is any Royalist rising in Birmingham I would like
      to avoid the place. I have no wish to get among the Royalists. Are there
      roads by which we can win east of Birmingham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I will sketch out a route for you, whereby you may reach the
      main highway some seven miles north of Birmingham, at Sutton Coldfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be much indebted to you, if you will be so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer retired to the guard-house and brought out a rude map of the
      district, which he gave to Armstrong after explaining it. He sent a
      soldier to set them on the right way when they had left the village. When
      the soldier had departed, and the two were once more alone, Armstrong
      turned in his saddle and looked back at the frowning towers of Warwick
      Castle, looming up through the trees, very suggestive of a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a narrow shave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have to thank you, Frances,
      that we have squeezed through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, circumstances are proving too strong for me,&rdquo; she said sorrowfully,
      &ldquo;and all my old ideas of right and wrong are being flouted day and night.
      Just now I have used truth for the purposes of falsehood, a fault which I
      chided in you earlier in our journey. I wish we were free of the
      entanglements and might be honest once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well. Have no fear, and I still insist that the Lord stands
      by us. We cannot meet force with force, and must use what craft we are
      possessed of. Cromwell uses it, and so does the King. Why should we be
      debarred? I think we are well out of that trap, and I am wondering how
      many hours will elapse before the commander is sorry he let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lunched on bread and cheese at a wayside hut, and once, when they
      reached the top of a hill, they saw what they took to be Birmingham away
      to the west. The by-roads they were traversing proved to be deserted, and
      they resolved to keep to them rather than seek the main highway at Sutton
      Coldfield or elsewhere, for they considered that their comparative
      slowness would be more than compensated for by greater safety. This course
      soon proved of doubtful wisdom. Without a guide the intricate lanes were
      puzzling, and often came to an end without any apparent reason. When they
      took to the fields the soil was heavy in many cases, and fatigued their
      horses, besides entangling them sometimes in low-lying lands that were
      almost marshes. To add to their difficulties the sun became obscured in a
      haze, and the temperature dropped sharply, condensing the moisture in the
      air about them, involving them in a mist that was worse than the darkest
      night. Still they struggled on, leaving the direction entirely to their
      horses. At last they came on what appeared to be a cart track, and,
      following it, they arrived at a labourer&rsquo;s hut which faced a lane.
      Armstrong, without dismounting, knocked at the door with his sword, and a
      frightened woman, holding it ajar, answered the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have lost our way,&rdquo; said the young man, throwing her a coin to bespeak
      good will; &ldquo;can you tell us where we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the woman, which proved a somewhat difficult
      question to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the nearest town to the north of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lichfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do we get to Lichfield from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow this lane to the cross-road, then take the lane to the left for
      two miles, and it will lead you into the main road. Turn to the right, and
      Lichfield is five or six miles further on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, instead of going to the main road, we keep to this lane, where will
      it lead us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It stops at the cross-road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will the lane turning to the right lead us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any way to the North except by the main road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you lived in this cottage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-three years, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know only the way to Lichfield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked the woman, and they rode on through the fog. The limited
      knowledge of the English peasantry regarding the geography of their own
      district had baffled him more than once during their journey, and this was
      but a fair example of the ignorance he had to contend against. He resolved
      to take the turn to the right in preference to the leftward lane. He
      feared Lichfield or any other place of similar size, and he dreaded the
      main road. It was impossible for Cromwell to patrol the whole country at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice, so the by-ways would be safer if less direct. Their
      progress had been so slow that there was ample time for a hard rider with
      relays of horses to have spread a warning far ahead of them, and now
      caution, rather than speed, was their game. These points he discussed with
      his companion as they rode along in the fog, and she agreed with his
      conclusions. Each tried to cheer the other, but both were undeniably
      discouraged by the conditions that surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a mile from the hut they came to the end of their road, with the
      horizontal lane at its head, extending east and west. As they turned to
      the right, some object loomed in the fog ahead, and there came a sharp
      cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the left,&rdquo; whispered Armstrong, turning his horse. Frances obeyed
      instantly, but the man in front fired his musket into the air and raised a
      shout, whereupon four others sprang from the dripping bushes, and two of
      them seized the reins of the startled horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resistance is useless,&rdquo; said the soldier hanging to the rein of the
      plunging Bruce, &ldquo;there are a hundred men along this lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no need to resist,&rdquo; cried Armstrong with affected indignation,
      although none realized so well as he that the game was up. &ldquo;We are
      peaceful travellers under safe-conduct from General Cromwell himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lieutenant will be here directly,&rdquo; said the man, and as he spoke a
      party of horsemen came galloping down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who fired that shot?&rdquo; cried the officer in charge. Before an answer could
      be given he came upon the two captives. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travellers to Carlisle, who have lost their way in the mist and are
      seeking the high road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have a pass, let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Armstrong, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pass does not say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prisoners. Where is the bugler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound the recall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man placed the bugle to his lips, and the merry notes rang out into
      the obscurity. All remained silent, then, like an echo from east and west,
      almost in unison, came a similar call; and faintly in the further distance
      another. The company seemed to increase mysteriously, as if pikemen were
      being distilled out of the fog, and after a roll-call, every name being
      answered, the lieutenant gave the word to march, and horse and foot set
      out for the west, the two prisoners in the centre of the phalanx. The head
      of Frances drooped, and Will rode close by her side as cheerful as ever,
      trying to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever man, this Cromwell,&rdquo; he whispered with admiration in his tones.
      &ldquo;You see what he has done? He has run thin lines across the country as
      fast as horses could gallop, stringing out the local men as they went
      along. We have probably blundered through one or two of these lines, but
      were bound to be caught sooner or later, unless we made for the coast on
      either side, and that would but have delayed things a bit, for there was
      little chance of us getting ship with all ports in his hands. It serves me
      right. I should have killed De Courcy and then galloped for it. However,
      the Lord stands by us, Frances; never forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look much like it,&rdquo; said the girl despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, nothing looks like itself in this accursed fog. Why could n&rsquo;t
      we have had this mist on the road from York? Still, I don&rsquo;t think it would
      have made any difference, once Cromwell&rsquo;s riders got to the north of us.
      Resourceful man, Oliver. I like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t. Yet you are supposed to be against him, and I am supposed to
      be for him. I fear him; I fear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no danger; not the slightest for either of us. You have done
      your task, and have done it well. I am the blunderer. But I stand on my
      status as a Scot, and I will argue the matter out with him. The man I
      tumbled into the ditch was the King&rsquo;s Chamberlain, and not a
      Parliamentarian, and a foreigner at that. The document I am supposed to
      carry was not given to me by the King, but taken by force from a minion of
      the King, and a Frenchman. I have assaulted no Englishman, and Cromwell
      knew I was travelling on this pass. He cannot deny that he wrote it, and
      for exactly the purpose it has served. Oh, I shall have a beautiful legal
      argument with Old Noll, and will upset him with his own law. I&rsquo;m in no
      danger; neither are you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust it will appear so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot appear otherwise. He was trying to frighten you when he said he
      would hang me. He is a sly, capable dog, who will be satisfied with having
      beaten me, and will not court trouble with my countrymen by hanging even a
      Borderer. It cost one of our Kings his throne to do the like of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation, with which there was no interference on the part of
      their captors, was brought to a conclusion by their arrival at the main
      road. Here a halt was called and the bugle was sounded, again to be
      answered, as before, from different directions. &ldquo;Dismount,&rdquo; said the
      officer to Armstrong, whereupon the latter, without a word, sprang to the
      ground. Against the next move he protested, but his opposition was
      unavailing and indeed unreplied to. The officer gave the lady and the two
      horses in charge of a party of six, with orders to take them to Lichfield
      and install them in the cathedral. A guard was to be set at the door, and
      no communication was to be allowed with any one outside. Orders from
      headquarters were to the effect that the lady was to be treated with every
      deference, and these orders were impressed upon the six men. The detached
      squad disappeared down the road in the fog, and Armstrong stood
      disconsolate and angry, but helpless, surrounded by troopers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monotony of waiting was relieved by the frequent arrival of companies
      from the east and from the west, who did not stay at the cross-roads,
      however, but marched south toward Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham. Thus
      the little company standing at arms was continually augmented, and
      continually reduced to its original size. It was waiting for some one
      higher in command than the mild lieutenant, and nearly two hours passed
      before this man, set in authority, arrived. Armstrong heard the trampling
      of horse to the south, and presently the sound of voices became quite
      audible through the fog. There seemed to be a dispute going forward, which
      was something unusual in the Parliamentary forces, where, if discipline
      appeared lax, instant obedience was invariably required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Colonel, I am to take charge of the lady and escort her to
      Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no orders to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come direct from Cromwell, and those were his orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not take orders from you. I hold written instructions relating to
      both the man and the woman, and these I shall carry out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be wise to hang the man on the nearest tree, and take his papers
      to Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this there was no reply, and Armstrong now knew that De Courcy had not
      been so badly hurt as he had pretended, for he had taken a long ride to
      the North since then. The prisoner recognized his voice long before his
      cavalier costume emerged from the mist. De Courcy had not changed his
      apparel, and it formed a strange contrast to the Parliamentary uniform, as
      indeed did Armstrong&rsquo;s own dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my young friend,&rdquo; cried De Courcy, the moment he recognized the
      prisoner, &ldquo;you had your laugh in the morning, and I have mine in the
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a time for everything,&rdquo; replied Armstrong indifferently, &ldquo;and my
      time for laughing is in the morning. It is brighter then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it looks rather dark for you at the moment, and you seem less merry
      than when I met you earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there were more amusing things happening then, that&rsquo;s all. How&rsquo;s your
      horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are neither of us the worse for our encounter. Do n&rsquo;t you wish you
      could say the same for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, and I thank you for your sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent the woman to Lichfield?&rdquo; asked the officer-in-chief of his
      subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Colonel; some two hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. We will relieve you of your prisoner. Take your men to
      Birmingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any truth in the Royalist rising there, Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the least. Have you heard anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but a rumor that there was an outbreak of some sort. I heard that
      a detachment from Lichfield was to leave for Birmingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will turn it back if we meet it. Good night!&rdquo; At the word the
      lieutenant and his men marched off to the south, and Armstrong was taken
      in charge by the squadron of horse. A trooper was dismounted and his steed
      given to Armstrong, of whom no questions were asked, as he had expected.
      They seemed very sure of their man. The cavalry set off to the North, and
      De Courcy rode close beside his enemy, taking a delight in taunting him.
      To this enforced companionship the Scot objected and made appeal to the
      colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, am I your prisoner, or do I belong to this renegade King&rsquo;s man? Who
      is in authority here,&mdash;you, or this Frenchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the colonel made no reply, nor did he order De Courcy to the rear,
      probably not wishing to offend one who seemed to be a friend of
      Cromwell&rsquo;s. The angry Scot was forced to make the best of it in silence,
      while the Frenchman, very polite and jocular, pressed ironic services upon
      him, asked after the girl, and said he would use his influence with
      Cromwell to have a silken rope used at the coming execution of so
      distinguished a spy. It is ill to tamper with a Border temper, as the
      Frenchman soon discovered. Armstrong slipped his knife from his belt and
      held it in readiness, when his attention was drawn to the trampling of an
      approaching host in front of them, and he remembered that here was coming
      the troop from Lichfield, which expected to meet a body of the King&rsquo;s men
      if the rumour from Birmingham were true. The rumour had no doubt been
      started by the riding North in hot haste of this courtier now at his side,
      at a time when such costume was not seen outside Oxford. Besides, the
      country was in a constant state of alarm, and the wildest tales were
      current, whose constant contradiction by afterevents did nothing to allay
      ever-recurring panic. Armstrong quietly gathered up his reins, watched his
      opportunity, and, instead of running his blade between the ribs of De
      Courcy, jabbed the point into the flank of the Frenchman&rsquo;s horse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;SANCTUARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>owever graceful
      the Frenchman might be on foot, and no one denied his elegance of bearing,
      he was but an amateur on horseback, and when his steed unexpectedly
      plunged forward he relinquished the reins and grasped the mane. For one
      brief moment the attention of the troop was diverted toward the
      unexplained antics of the maddened horse and the imminent overthrow of its
      rider. It is one of the defects of human nature that man is prone to laugh
      when he sees a fellow creature in some predicament from which his own
      superior skill leaves him free. Every man in the company was a faultless
      rider, and nothing their horses could do would have been any embarrassment
      to them. To see this dandified foreigner, whom at heart they despised in
      any case, crouching like a gaudily dressed monkey on a frolicsome dog, and
      screaming for help, was too much for even the saddest of them, and a roar
      of laughter went up which did nothing toward quieting the injured and
      frightened quadruped. If it had been the horse of Armstrong that had begun
      these dancings, his guards would have been instantly on the alert for an
      attempted escape, but at the very moment their eyes should have been on
      the Scot their attention was withdrawn. Armstrong did not laugh, but,
      thrusting back his knife, whipped out his sword, and struck De Courcy&rsquo;s
      horse twice with the broad of it. His own steed leaped forward under the
      prick of the spur, and before the colonel could give a word of command the
      two had disappeared in the fog ahead. Even then the colonel, who was the
      only man that had his wits about him, did not think there was the least
      chance of escape, for he had heard the troop coming toward him, and
      Armstrong must run directly into it. He rose in his stirrups to give the
      alarm to those ahead, when all heard a ringing shout: &ldquo;Charge, cavaliers!
      God save the King! To hell with the Roundheads! Charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the fog came a spattering fire, then a volley. Two horses and three
      men went down, while the other troopers hastily unslung their carbines and
      fired down the street without waiting for the word of command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, you fools!&rdquo; yelled the colonel, &ldquo;you are shooting your own men.&rdquo;
       Then to the oncomers he roared a like warning, which was drowned in
      another volley. The Lichfield men were not to be taken in, even if they
      had heard the warning. With their own eyes they had seen two cavaliers
      burst upon them out of the fog with a strident cry for the King. De
      Courcy, coming first, they concentrated upon him, and he went down before
      them. Armstrong, swinging his sword, smiting right and left, bellowing
      like a fiend in true cavalier style, a very Prince Rupert come again,
      dashed at the weakest spot, and his impetuosity carried all before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; cried the leader, as some would have pursued. &ldquo;Fire, and
      break their charge,&rdquo; and fire they did right stoutly, until a maddened
      officer, with a bravery that scorned the bullets around him, galloped
      along their front, waving his sword and commanding them to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are killing your own men! There are no Royalists, but an interfering
      fool of a Frenchman and an escaped Scot. Back to Lichfield!&rdquo; Nevertheless,
      a battle is not quelled at a word, and the brave colonel pressed through
      among them and galloped in pursuit of his late prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once clear of the clash, Armstrong was not sparing of a horse that
      belonged to someone else. At great risk to his neck he raced through the
      blind fog, sword in hand, ready for further opposition should he meet it.
      He emerged from the fog with a suddenness that startled him. The sun had
      set, and there, barely a mile away, stood out against the darkening sky
      the great red bulk of the cathedral with its war-broken towers, and the
      little town huddled at its feet. At the same moment he became aware that
      some one was thundering after him, and again he dug the cruel spurs into
      the labouring horse. A glance over his shoulder showed him the colonel
      breaking through the bank of fog, and he thought of turning and fighting
      him on the run, but the sound of firing had ceased, and he knew the
      colonel would prove a stouter combatant than the Frenchman, so he hurried
      on. Aside from this, Lichfield had been roused by the sound of the guns,
      and he saw the long narrow street that lay between him and the cathedral
      becoming alive with pikemen, and knew he would have his work cut out for
      him if he was to get safely through the town. As soon as he came within
      earshot he shouted to them: &ldquo;Barricade the street! The King is upon us. I
      have just escaped. Our men are on the retreat. Defend the town to the
      south. Barricade! Barricade!&rdquo; Thus he clattered through Lichfield,
      shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soldiers are so accustomed to the word of command that they obey first and
      think after, if at all. Seeing a rider in the costume of a cavalier come
      tearing down upon them, they made hasty preparation for stopping him; but
      his tone of authority was so well assumed that they gave way before him,
      and began the running out of carts and whatever other obstructions they
      could lay their hands upon, to make the way difficult for the oncoming
      colonel, who swore as loudly at their stupidity as if he were the King&rsquo;s
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you about, you accursed clodhoppers? Don&rsquo;t you know a King&rsquo;s man
      when you see one? Leave that rubbish and follow me to the cathedral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong&rsquo;s horse, nearly done, staggered over the bridge and up the
      slight incline that led to the cathedral precincts. Across the grounds
      surrounding the church had been raised a great earthwork, and the battered
      west front of the sacred building showed that war had been no respecter of
      sculptured beauty. A lone pikeman paced up and down before the cathedral
      door, but paused as he saw this impetuous rider, whose horse had stumbled
      and fallen at the top of the rubbish heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you there?&rdquo; shouted Armstrong, springing nimbly from his fallen
      horse. &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t you hear the firing? Down to the street and help your
      comrades; the town is attacked! Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told to stand here,&rdquo; objected the bewildered guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, confound you! Do you question the word of an officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, trailing his pike, ran, and disappeared down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, Frances, are you within? Open the small door; it is I,
      Armstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I knew you would come,&rdquo; he heard her say, and then followed the
      welcome rattle of the bolts. But they must be speedily drawn if they were
      to clear the way for a man hard pressed. Over the barricade surged a wave
      of pikemen, twoscore or more, the mounted colonel behind them, urging them
      on with pungent oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanctuary! Sanctuary!&rdquo; shouted Armstrong, raising his sword aloft,
      standing under the arched doorway, steadfast as one of the stone knights
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanctuary be damned!&rdquo; cried the colonel, urging his horse up the
      embankment. &ldquo;Down on him, you dogs, and take him dead or alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the cursing of the colonel; in spite of the battered condition
      of the great church; in spite of the deadening influence of the war, the
      cry of &ldquo;Sanctuary&rdquo; struck home to many of the hearts there opposed to the
      fugitive, and the pike-topped crest of the human wave paused for one brief
      instant, yet it was enough. Before the wave broke and fell, the small door
      gave and swung inward. As the pikes rattled against it, Armstrong had the
      bars and bolts in their places again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break down that door!&rdquo; he heard the colonel roar outside, while the
      impetuous William clasped the girl in his arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, lassie, I&rsquo;m glad to meet you again, although it&rsquo;s just dark enough
      in this place for the seeing of any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman shook herself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wasted too much time at that before. Let it be a lesson to us. This
      place is a stable. Our horses are well fed, and the saddles are still on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there a way out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a small door in the northeast corner. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be guarded, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I think they wanted me to escape, for they went out that way after
      barring the front door. But they did n&rsquo;t think you would be with me when I
      took my leave. Come quickly, or they will be round to it from the front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it. The colonel is a Birmingham man and a powerful swearer, who
      knows nothing of this church&mdash;or any other, I think. The men will not
      remember the back door until it is too late, and then I pity them; they
      will hear language from the colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two made their way to the farther end of the cathedral, where the
      horses were stalled. The vast nave was dark and would soon be black as a
      cellar until the moon rose. It was used as a military storehouse, as a
      stable, and as a dormitory for troops when the accommodation in the town
      was overtaxed. As Armstrong and his companion stumbled over obstructions
      toward the horses, the spacious chamber rang with the impact of timber
      against the stubborn doors. Frances, knowing the geography of the place,
      led the way with her horse, and Armstrong followed with his. Once outside,
      there was more light than he wished for, but their way to the rear was
      clear, and, mounting, he took the lead, crossing an alpine ridge which had
      done duty during the siege, and taking a somewhat terrifying leap down to
      the greensward of the field at the back of the cathedral. Then they ran
      north through a slight valley, and, for the moment, were safe from
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon will be up soon,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;and I do n&rsquo;t know whether
      to welcome it or fear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do neither, as we have no influence one way or another, and must
      bear its disadvantages or the reverse, as chance wills. Now tell me what
      happened. How did you escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tale was soon told, half humorously, as if it were an escapade rather
      than an escape, and the narrator wound up with a determination to avoid
      the main road in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I do not agree with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been alone in that
      cathedral some three hours or more, and have had time to think. You said
      we blundered into the ambuscade, and so we did. You have hewn your way out
      by a marvellous combination of luck and prowess, but such exploits are not
      to be depended upon. You must use your mind, as well as your right arm and
      the swiftness of your horse, if you are to win Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, you discourage me: I looked upon my escape rather as a triumph
      of wit than of muscle. The setting of the Roundheads at each other&rsquo;s
      throats in the mist seemed an inspiration, and the cry of &lsquo;Sanctuary&rsquo; gave
      me just the moment of time that was needed. Your estimate of me is that of
      the Reverend Henderson of Edinburgh, who held I had barely sense enough to
      direct a stout blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I give you full credit for great ingenuity, but we stumbled upon,
      the Parliamentarians with no plans made. Everything has been done on the
      spur of the moment, and has not been thought out before the crisis came. A
      few chance remarks got us clear at Warwick; while inspiration and a fog
      were your safety at Lichfield, and even then by one brief instant of time.
      The recurrence of such strokes of luck and good management are not to be
      looked for. Some time the moment needed will go against us, and then all
      is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. What do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose we take to the main road again, which must be near at hand on
      our left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget we have no pass from Cromwell now. The lieutenant has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have a pass for yourself the moment you are north of Manchester,
      which cannot be more than fifty miles away. We must get over those miles
      as speedily as possible; therefore the main road is our route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if it were practicable; surely danger lies thick along the main
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so. While in the cathedral I heard troop after troop of
      men going northward. They will carry the news of your capture, but not of
      your escape. Until they beat in the door of the cathedral and search the
      place thoroughly, no messenger will be sent North. We are ahead of them
      once more, with the news of your capture travelling in front of us. We
      will keep ahead so long as we ride fast and until we stop somewhere for
      the night; then they having relays of horses, while we have only our own,
      will pass us. We cannot ride all night, or we shall kill our horses; but
      We can cover a good deal of the ground between here and Manchester. Once
      north of Manchester I think you are fairly safe. So I propose we ride now
      for the main road, and keep going as long as our horses are able to
      travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed; but, following your own instructions, what are we to say when we
      are stopped? We have no pass, so how am I to account for myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a Roundhead soldier, sent on to Manchester by the colonel at
      Lichfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look like a Roundhead soldier!&rdquo; cried William, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will. It is always well to have some one in a travelling party who
      can think. Have you not noticed the load you carry behind your saddle?&rdquo;
       Armstrong turned. The rising moon displayed a steel cap that looked like
      an overturned pot and a bundle of cloth, all neatly strapped on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cathedral is a storehouse for uniforms and accoutrements enough to
      fit out a regiment. I selected the largest suit I could find, with cloak
      and cap, and belted them to your saddle. Now I shall hold your horse while
      you go into the thicket and change your raiment. Conceal your cavalier
      costume as well as you can, so that, if they trace us over this fog-sodden
      turf, which is likely, they will get no hint of your new appearance. It
      might be well to climb a tree and tie your discarded shell among the
      leaves, with the straps that bind the bundle to your horse, and be careful
      to leave neither the King&rsquo;s message nor your purse with your finery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy omen for future domestic peace that the huge man did at
      once and without question what the comparatively fragile young woman bade
      him, she holding his horse while he made the rapid change. When he
      emerged, the horse plunged, and she had some ado to hold him until he
      heard his master&rsquo;s voice and laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, verily, this is a transformation indeed,&rdquo; cried Armstrong, looking
      at himself in the moonlight. &ldquo;My name is Hezekiah, and the steel cap is a
      thought on the small side, but the rest o&rsquo; the duds are not so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cap was the largest I could find,&rdquo; laughed the girl, &ldquo;and will fit
      closely enough when your locks are shorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Must I sacrifice this vanity of Absalom as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. If I am to be your Delilah, I must fulfill my duty. I searched
      the whole cathedral for that which would do the work of shears, but could
      find nothing. However, the first cottage we come to will supply us with a
      suitable instrument. Now mount, and let us away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They speedily came upon the main road, and cantered on through the
      beautiful night, determined to put fifty miles, or thereabout, between
      themselves and Lichfield, but before they had accomplished half that
      distance Armstrong saw that the girl was completely exhausted in spite of
      her disclaimers, for, aside from the tiresome day&rsquo;s travel, she had had
      little sleep the night before. It was most tempting to push on, for the
      night was perfect and the road was good. Even though they passed through
      several villages they were not questioned. Soldiers in drab cloaks and
      steel caps were too common on the road to cause comment, and they were, as
      yet, in advance of any news of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came to a farmhouse near the roadside, and Armstrong beat up
      the inmates, bringing a woman&rsquo;s head to an opened window. At first she
      would admit no one at that hour of the night, but the moon shining on the
      steel cap and the long cloak apparently gave her confidence. Her husband
      was in the south with Cromwell, she said. She could make a place in the
      house for the lady, but the soldier would find better accommodation than
      he was accustomed to in an outhouse. With this Armstrong expressed himself
      as amply satisfied. They dismounted, and he led away the horses. He found
      a place for them in a shed, examined them, and rubbed them down with care.
      Having satisfied himself that they were none the worse for their long
      journey, he attended to their wants and flung down some bundles of straw
      for his own night&rsquo;s lodging. He began to think he must go supperless, or
      run the risk of foraging in an unknown pantry, if he could find entrance,
      when he saw Frances approach from the house with a loaf of bread and a
      lump of cheese on a trencher, and a measure of ale. He met her half way
      and relieved her of the load. Under her arm she carried some cumbrous
      weapon, which she brought out when he assumed the burden of the provender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pair of sheep-shears, which the woman tells me is all she has,
      but I assured her they were most suitable for my purpose. Now sit on this
      stone here in the moonlight and be shorn; for we must set out in the
      daylight without those long locks of yours. You look too much like the
      King, even with your cloak and steel cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed softly as she said this, and snapped the big shears
      menacingly. He sat on the stone like the obedient young man he was, shook
      out his lion&rsquo;s mane, and in a few moments was bereft of it. The girl stood
      back and surveyed her work, laughing, but nevertheless with a tinge of
      regret in her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a pity!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;All the King&rsquo;s horses and all the King&rsquo;s
      men are not worth the sacrifice. I hope it will grow again, for, if not,
      the Philistines be upon thee, Samson. Your dearest friend would n &lsquo;t know
      you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong smiled ruefully and passed his hand in anxious doubt over his
      cropped head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it will grow again, unless my dearest friend refuses to
      acknowledge me with this curtailment, when I shall become bald through
      grief at her defection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make no promises, if you mean me. I shall very likely reconsider. You
      are never the man who cast a glamour over me at Oxford and elsewhere. I
      fear I am no true Parliamentarian after all, but I shall not come to a
      decision until I see you in the daylight. Perhaps the cap will be an
      improvement, but I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He squeezed on the cap, which was still too small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bones of my ancestors, it will need Peter, the blacksmith of
      Gilnockie, to get this off again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is worse and worse,&rdquo; urged his tormentor. &ldquo;I cannot bear the sight
      any longer, or it will drive sleep away from me. Good night, my poor,
      shorn Samson,&rdquo;&mdash;and she was off before he could spring up and
      intercept her.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;EXPEDIENCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>reat is the
      recuperative power of youth, and shortly after sunrise the two were on the
      road again, refreshed and with high courage, to face the outcome of
      another long ride. They had travelled farther than their estimate of the
      night before, and so found themselves but little more than twenty miles
      south of Manchester. In the night the weather had undergone another
      change, and the sun was hidden, while now and then a scurry of rain passed
      over them. To the North the outlook was black and lowering. They were
      approaching the land of storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made up my mind,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;that we must part. No, it is not
      on account of that cropped head of yours, but rather to save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking myself that it is wrong you should share my danger,
      when there is nothing to hinder you from going across country to your own
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go across my country until I have seen you safely into your
      own. But, as you know, the swearing colonel and his men are not looking
      for me. Perhaps they think I took the opportunity left open to get away
      from the cathedral; but on the other hand, if wise, they must have looked
      for our horses&rsquo; tracks, and then they learned we left Lichfield together.
      I propose to act as your scout. I shall ride a mile or two ahead, and if I
      am stopped, you will strike to the right or to the left, and avoid the
      danger if you can. On every elevation I reach I will stand for a few
      moments. If my horse faces west, the way between us is safe; if he faces
      east, there is danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, I would rather run the risk and have your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you would, but&rdquo;&mdash;and she laughed&mdash;&ldquo;now that you are
      clipped, you are the one who is beautiful, and I the one who is wise. It
      is really to your advantage that I should see as little of my Roundhead
      lover as possible, and you would be foolish to detain me, for I cannot
      help glancing at you now and then, and whenever I do, I sigh for the
      cavalier who wooed me yesterday. Women are not so changeable as they say,
      and I am constant to my first adorer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this William made no reply, gazing somewhat gloomily at the storm away
      on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; she cried, riding alongside and touching his hand. &ldquo;I have
      offended his vanity, and he doesn&rsquo;t like to be laughed at. Poor boy, you
      little know what is in store for you. Don&rsquo;t you understand you will have
      enough of my company in the days to come, and may well spare some of it
      now? I shall not disown my promise if you remind me of it when your
      love-locks are over your shoulders again. But, seriously, my plan is a
      good one unless you have a better to propose. We must quit the main road
      now, and avoid Manchester as we avoided Birmingham, but we should have a
      care that we do not ride into another ambuscade, and if I go first that
      may be prevented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I see you interfered with, I will just gallop to your assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall do nothing so foolish. No one in England is going to injure me;
      but you are not safe until you are over the Scottish line. We shall be
      north of Manchester in three or four hours, and then you have your own
      pass. You are really a most creditable Roundhead. After Manchester we can
      travel in company again, if you wish. Have you anything better to
      propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I propose we stay together and take our chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; she cried gaily, touching up her horse, then, over her
      shoulder as she galloped off, &ldquo;Remember. West, safety; east, danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong had not only to curb his own inclination, but his horse as well,
      who viewed with evident disapproval the departure of his mate. At the
      summit of the first hill the girl turned her horse across the road facing
      west, waved her hand to him, and disappeared over the crest. And thus the
      journey went on; sometimes two miles between them, sometimes less.
      Manchester was seen and left in the rear. He now tried to catch up with
      her, but she kept valorously ahead, as if she were some fabled siren
      luring the poor man on. For a time he lost sight of her, then, as he
      mounted a hill, saw her standing on a crest a mile away, like an
      equestrian statue against an inky sky; but this time her horse faced the
      east, and he thought she was motioning with her handkerchief in that
      direction. She stood there until he sent his horse over the hedge and made
      in the direction of a forest, then the darkness seemed to swallow her up.
      He skirted the edge of the wood. Rain was now coming down heavily, but
      before it blotted out the landscape he passed the head of a valley and saw
      dimly through the downpour a large encampment of white tents. A man in
      drab on a black charger stood little chance of being seen against the dark
      forest from the encampment, but he moved on as rapidly as he could,
      knowing that if a lull came in the deluge he ran great risk of detection
      by the outposts. Some distance on he stood for a time under the trees,
      blessing the long cloak, which formerly he had maligned for its ugliness,
      for now it proved of good material and waterproof. The girl had evidently
      gone directly down into the camp, and he was at a loss what to do. Duty
      called him to press forward to the North, but duty is often an
      ill-favoured jade whose strident voice is outdistanced by the soft whisper
      of a beautiful woman. Armstrong dared not shout, and the deluge formed an
      impenetrable curtain whichever way he turned. He skirted the wood for some
      time, then crossed the fields to the west until he came to the road which
      trended North from the camp. Here he stood in the rain, and wondered
      whether she was detained, or whether she had already passed the spot he
      now occupied. They had made no arrangement for meeting again in case they
      should lose sight of each other, and he blamed himself for his negligence
      on this important point. One thing was certain. It was useless to stand
      here until he was dissolved. Even his stout-hearted horse had assumed an
      attitude of the utmost dejection, with drooping head, the water pouring
      off every part of him. Should the weather clear, which he was compelled to
      confess there seemed little likelihood of it doing, he was in danger so
      near the camp. He resolved to turn North, go on until he reached some
      place of shelter, and there wait. Progress was slow, for the lane had
      become a quagmire. The forest which he had skirted extended now to the
      west, and the road became a woodland track, but just where it began to
      penetrate into the wilderness there shone upon him a ray of hope. From an
      overhanging branch of the first tree hung a limp and dripping white rag,
      tied by one on horseback in such a position that it might brush the face
      of a rider passing that way. He took it down, and it proved to be a lady&rsquo;s
      handkerchief. If he had followed the edge of the wood, he could hardly
      have missed it; if he came along the lane he was almost certain to see it.
      He thrust this token under his cloak and chirruped to his discouraged
      horse. When something like a mile had been cast behind him, his horse
      neighed, and was answered by another further ahead. Then he came to a
      forester&rsquo;s hut, and in an open shed, sheltered from the storm, stood the
      companion of Bruce, who showed lively pleasure at the encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the hut a cheerful sight met his eyes. A fire of faggots blazed on
      the hearth, and before it stood a radiant young woman, arranging the
      brands to their better burning with the tip of her boot. On a high stool
      was spread her steaming cloak. In a far corner sat the old forester and
      his wife, frowning on their visitor and their newly arrived guest; for
      strangers were viewed with universal suspicion by high and low, little
      good ever coming of them in the minds of the peasantry, while the chance
      of danger was always present; danger whether hospitality was proffered or
      withheld. There was more likelihood of entertaining devils unaware than
      angels, and well the afflicted poor knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, less risk lay in succoring a steel cap than a feathered hat, so
      the moment the dripping horseman shoved in the door, the old woman rose
      and began to set out a meal of dark bread and swine&rsquo;s flesh, boiled and
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here you are at last,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I was beginning to fear I
      should have to go back to the camp for you. Did you find my token?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. Findings are keepings. You cannot prove your right to the
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, honest travellers are few, as these good people seem to think.
      Throw off your cloak. Here is a wooden hook by the fire that I have kept
      for it. Draw up your stool and eat. I was so hungry that I didn&rsquo;t wait.
      You see what it is to possess a good conscience once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I possess a good appetite any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sit down, and I shall be your waiting-maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Great news, for I am the very princess of scouts. One thing at a
      time, however, and the one thing now is this black bread, which is like
      the old woman here, better than it looks. We can get nothing for our
      horses at this place, so must set out again as soon as possible, in spite
      of the rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his meal and stood again with her before the fire,
      she whispered to him: &ldquo;You must not pay these people too lavishly. They
      are somewhat near the camp, and although they do not seem over talkative
      it is better to run no risks. Bargain with them; be as a very Jew in
      computation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better than that. I&rsquo;ll be a very Scot, and so save money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once on the road again, she gave him her budget of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a hero, William Armstrong. England is ringing with your exploits,
      and I never dreamed with what a valorous knight of old I travelled. It
      seems you stormed Warwick Castle and took it. You passed unseen through
      cordons of troops, and it is suspected you have dealings with the Devil,
      who travels beside you in the guise of a female, as is right and proper,
      and who appears and disappears at her will. Single-handed, you scattered
      two armies at Lichfield&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, give the Devil her due!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her aid, of course; that is always understood. You attacked
      Lichfield cathedral and captured it, and there is much disapproval among
      the peasantry that Cromwell had formerly dismantled it, for they think
      that if this had not been done the holy belongings of the place would have
      baffled you. The cathedral now reeks of sulphur, and you escaped in a
      whirl of flame amid a storm of bullets. They know that nothing will
      prevail against you but a silver pellet, and even that must be well aimed.
      So I am not sure but I have been mistaken in disguising you, for if any
      Cavalier shows himself in the North, the inhabitants are like to take him
      for Satan and fly from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are not good Christians, for they are told to resist the Devil
      and he will flee from them. You think, then, that my fiendish character
      will protect me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; but you have nothing to fear between here and Carlisle. I thought
      you said De Courcy had been killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went down, and I supposed him shot, but was in too much of a hurry to
      inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and others rode to the North last night, and they are now between us
      and Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has as many lives as a cat. If that is the case, why do you say the
      road to Carlisle is clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because from Carlisle to Newcastle, right across England, the cordon is
      to be stretched, and from Carlisle west to the coast. Before we can reach
      there; a line of men, almost within touching distance of each other, will
      extend from sea to sea, and all traffic North will be stopped. A thousand
      pounds is on your head, and Cromwell thinks to stay you, not with silver,
      but with gold. The General himself is on his way North, to see that you
      are trapped, or to be ready for any outbreak of the Scots should you win
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I have been unable to convince Oliver that I am the devil, since
      he takes such excellent human means of frustrating me. A thousand pounds!
      And yet you held that first day I was of slight value!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have confessed my error since. The camp I visited is breaking up
      to-day, and moving on to Carlisle. Twenty-three thousand men, I was told,
      but, being mostly foot, there is no chance of their overtaking us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the North looks black with more than rain, though goodness knows
      there is enough of that. I wish I were in Glasgow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the plan-maker of this foray. What do <i>you</i> propose to do,
      or have you thought of that yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not only thought of it, but have received instructions on it. I
      have heard the officers discuss what should be done, but I want to hear
      your conclusions first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. The line runs from the west coast to Newcastle. At Newcastle I
      am more than forty miles from Scotland at the nearest point, while at
      Carlisle I am less than ten. Every step east I go, I am placing myself
      more and more at a disadvantage, yet I might go east simply because of
      this, and because they know that I know that they know I am on the road to
      Carlisle. Having fallen into one ambush, they will imagine me on the
      constant outlook for another. Going free for so long, they might even
      count on my increasing carelessness, but shrewd men would not lippen to
      that Knowing I am singlehanded and can make no stand, they will expect me
      to creep through at night, either east or west of Carlisle, and as near as
      may be to that place, trusting to the short distance and the fleetness of
      my horse in a race for the Scottish Border. I am a hillsman, accustomed to
      threading my way through a wild country, with a keen eye for an enemy. I
      have avoided all the big towns, Birmingham, Manchester, and the like, so
      they will not expect me to risk either Newcastle or Carlisle. Night will
      be the time when they are greatly on the alert, especially if this storm
      continues. Very well again. Who am I, if questioned? I am a trooper of
      Cromwell&rsquo;s own horse, sent North from Warwick, having seen this escaped
      devil of a Scot, and therefore the more likely to identify him. I have
      become detached from my company in the storm. I will ride into Carlisle in
      broad daylight, and ask where the Warwick horse are to be found. They were
      ordered to Carlisle, I shall say. I shall not avoid the commander, but
      will seek for him. Then, if I can saunter over the bridge, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hoorah
      for Scotland,&rsquo; and may the best hoofs win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;and well reasoned. They all agreed that Carlisle
      was the weakest link in the chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they so? Then that makes me hesitate. If those in Carlisle think it
      the weakest link, they will strengthen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s plan was not so bold as yours. Of course they did not know
      you were travelling in the likeness of one of themselves. They thought you
      would abandon your horse before you came to Carlisle, creep into that town
      after dark, avoid the bridge, which is sure to be well guarded, swim the
      Eden, and be across the Scottish border by daylight. There are two defects
      in your own proposal; your accent is not that of Warwickshire, and De
      Courcy is sure to be in Carlisle and may recognize you. Besides this, you
      may meet some one who knows the Warwick regiments, and you are not even
      acquainted with the name of the captain of your supposed company. I think
      the night attempt more like to prosper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the night every one is on the alert, and a Roundhead cannot be
      distinguished from a cavalier, so there is closer scrutiny. I can enact
      the stupid trooper to perfection, having natural gifts toward stupidity.
      There is a risk, of course, but this is a risky journey at best. If I once
      get over the bridge at Carlisle, I&rsquo;ll beat all England in a race for the
      Border.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will. I said I would see you across into Scotland, but I am
      convinced that purpose is futile, and I shall prove but a danger to you. A
      Warwick trooper on duty does not wander over the country a-squiring of
      dames. I have given you good advice and a Roundhead&rsquo;s equipment, and have
      acted as your scout, so I must not imperil your mission by hanging to the
      skirt of that sopping cloak. To-night we shall likely reach Yorkshire, and
      to-morrow I bid you God speed and make across the county to my own home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, lass, I have come so to depend on you, I shall be but a lost
      sheep, shorn at that, if you leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is tempered to all such, and if you depend on your own wit you
      are likely to prosper. But you should have some care for me. It is my own
      safety I am thinking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the day was far from being one that incited toward hilarity,
      Armstrong laughed, and turned his dripping face up to the storm. The girl
      joined him, but with less of merriment in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never persuade me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is a tinge of
      selfishness about you, or that you ever think of yourself when there is a
      friend to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is worse to come,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I must beg of you to sacrifice
      that moustache. You will never get through Carlisle with that on your lip.
      Anyone who has ever seen you before would recognize you now, in spite of
      cloak and cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you ask too much. The kingdom of England may fall, but this
      moustache, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;If you saw it at this moment you would not be
      so proud of it. It has drooped and wilted in the rain like a faded flower.
      &rsquo;Twere better done away with, for it will mark you out from the
      smooth-faced troopers who throng Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William somewhat wistfully wrung the water from it, and attempted to draw
      it out across his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I suspect your design. One by one you have depleted me of what
      goes to make up a Borderer, and gradually you have reduced me to the
      commonplace level of those crop-eared villains who are fighting against
      their King. Then, when I come to you and say, &lsquo;I beseech you to fulfill
      your promise to me,&rsquo; you will reply, &lsquo;Away, Hezekiah, I know you not.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;T is near to that point now, and a little more or less will make
      slight difference with me, while it will greatly aid your passage through
      Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be well to have my ears cropped also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are somewhat prominent, now that your locks are gone. I wish I had
      brought those shears with me. You see now why I must leave you. Oh, the
      vanity of man! The self-conceit of woman is a molehill compared with a
      mountain. But take courage, William. I shall not be near you when the deed
      is done, and the moustache sacrificed, and you will wait in Scotland until
      it grows again. Perhaps by that time our English troubles will be
      finished, and thus Armstrong and England will be their true selves at the
      same moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had long since reached the main road and were making way as well as
      they could through the mud. The rain had not ceased, nor did it show any
      sign of ceasing. It needed frivolous talk to keep the spirits up in such
      weather. The young woman was earnest enough in her resolve to further his
      disguise by the means she had suggested, but to this she could not get
      Armstrong to say either yea or nay. He changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me how you managed to get so much information in the camp.
      Did they let you pass unquestioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened that I knew the officer in charge, and he knew me, and was
      rather apologetic in his demeanour toward me, for he was one of those of
      the court-martial who condemned my brother, I told him, truly enough, that
      I had been to see Cromwell and had obtained his complete pardon. That I
      had seen the General at Northampton, where he had made me a promise, and
      again at Broughton Castle, where he had redeemed it. I was now on my way
      home; that was all. The officer was very glad indeed to hear of my
      success, and said, what was also true, that he had deeply regretted the
      condemnation, but that the court could not do otherwise with the evidence
      before it. He had no suspicion that I was the female fiend who accompanied
      the man they sought, and as the talk was all of this man I could not help
      but hear, and was indeed very glad to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As evening drew on, conversation lagged, and they rode silently together,
      keeping doggedly to the work in hand, in spite of the flagging energies of
      their horses and their own bedraggled weariness. The rain fell with
      pitiless steadiness, and darkness came on early, with no chance of a moon
      being visible that night. The welcome light of a town twinkled ahead at
      last, and they resolved to stop there unless the risk threatened to be
      overwhelming. At the outskirts they learned that they had reached
      Clitheroe, and that &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; inn offered fair accommodation for man and
      beast. They were not to reach Yorkshire that night, and had accomplished
      less than thirty miles from Manchester. They dismounted at &ldquo;The Star,&rdquo; two
      very water-soaked persons, and their reception was far from being
      particularly cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you one of the troopers billeted here tonight?&rdquo; asked the host, who
      appeared not over pleased to welcome such enforced guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I pay for my accommodation. I am an officer of the Warwick horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was warned this morning to keep all the room I had for a company from
      Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that need not trouble you. They will not be here to-night. They did
      not strike camp until this afternoon, later than they expected. Should any
      arrive who have a better right here than I, I will turn out, at whatever
      time of the night it is necessary. I want two rooms, and a sitting-room
      with a big fire. And get us a hot supper as soon as you can. There is good
      stabling for the horses, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best in Lancashire. You are on this hide-and-seek business, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord had become wonderfully genial, now that there was the
      prospect of good orders and gold ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hide-and-seek business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This slippery Scot. Have you got him yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is thought he has made for the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you fear, sir. I know that kind of cattle, and have had them
      staying with me many&rsquo;s the time. He&rsquo;ll take to the hills, and you mark my
      word, unless you hold hands across England, you&rsquo;ll not catch him, and even
      then you&rsquo;ll have to look well to your feet, or he&rsquo;ll slip through between
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly, see how a man on horseback can do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mark my word, they&rsquo;ll be looking for a man on horseback, and he&rsquo;ll be
      sneaking through the grass; then they&rsquo;ll be looking in the grass, and he&rsquo;s
      whistled to his horse and is off over the hills. I know they chaps, and
      have played blind man&rsquo;s buff with them myself. You mark my word, that lad
      is in Scotland before to-morrow night, and laughing at you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You try to catch an eel by diving after it, and all you get is a
      wetting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m wet enough now, landlord, and have caught no eel yet, so if
      you&rsquo;ll order a brisk fire going, we will see what we can do in the way of
      eels tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It proved that Armstrong was quite right about the non-arrival of the
      Manchester contingent, and his deep slumber was not disturbed by any
      notice to quit. All night long the rain lashed down, but at daybreak it
      ceased, although the heavy clouds hung low in the sky. After a good
      breakfast the two set out, and were not molested or questioned as they
      passed from under the shadow of the castle at Clitheroe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;VICTORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>espite the night&rsquo;s
      rest, the horses were stiff after the long struggle with rain and mud the
      day before. If the situation was to be saved by a race, there seemed
      little chance of success with animals so tired and discouraged. With the
      exception of the departure from Oxford, the riders were more silent and
      melancholy than at any other time during their journey together. They had
      discussed the case in all its bearings the previous night, before the
      blazing fire, and had come to the conclusion that it would be safer to
      part. Armstrong was now in a country that he knew reasonably well, and he
      had no need to ask his direction from any chance comer, which was an
      advantage to a fugitive. They had agreed to deflect toward the east and
      bid good-bye to each other at Kirby Stephen, he striking northwest to
      Penrith, and she taking the main road east, entering Durham at Barnard
      Castle. There was no blinking the fact that while a Parliamentarian
      trooper might pass through this land unquestioned, especially as so many
      soldiers were making their way North, a trooper with a beautiful young
      woman of aristocratic appearance would certainly cause comment and excite
      curiosity. The nearer they came to Carlisle, the greater would be the
      danger of embarrassing questions. They had a wild country to traverse,
      bleak hills and moorland, and the roads as bad as they could be; but
      although they left Clitheroe at five o&rsquo;clock it was past noontide before
      they reached Kirby Stephen, a distance of less than forty miles. They had
      met no one, and so far as the morning section of the journey was
      concerned, the road to Scotland was clear enough. At the squalid inn of
      Kirby Stephen they partook of what each thought was their last meal
      together for a long time to come, and then, in spite of her protests, he
      accompanied her east out of the town and into the lonely hill country. At
      last she pulled up her horse, and impetuously thrust out her right hand,
      dashing away some tear-drops from her long lashes with her left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; she cried, the broken voice belieing the assumed cheerfulness
      of the tone. &ldquo;I cannot allow you to come farther. You must now bid
      farewell to your scout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lass, it breaks my heart to part with you in this way,&rdquo; stammered
      William, engulphing her small hand in both of his, then drawing her to
      him. &ldquo;It shames my manhood to let you go this wild road alone. I must see
      you to your own door, in spite of all the Cromwells that ever broke their
      country&rsquo;s laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;We went over all that last night, and settled it.
      I am safe enough. It is you who are in danger. You will come to me when
      this trouble is passed and done with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Andrew, I&rsquo;ll come to you as soon as this letter is in Traquair&rsquo;s
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, no, no! Cromwell is a hard man, and if you steal through his
      cordon you must not come within his power in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear, lass, he dare not touch me. Once my foot&rsquo;s in Scotland, I&rsquo;m like
      that ancient chap you told me of; I draw virtue from the soil and am
      unassailable. Cromwell wants nothing of me when this packet escapes him.
      I&rsquo;ll turn back from Traquair the moment I give it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not permit such folly; remember that.&rdquo; She wept a little, then
      laughed a little. &ldquo;I do not wish to see you until your hair is grown
      again. My Scottish Samson, you must come to me with flowing locks, as when
      I first saw you, so that I may forget I have been your Delilah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer he kissed her protesting lips again and again, then she hid her
      face in his sombre cloak and sobbed quietly. The patient horses, now
      accustomed to any vagaries on the part of their owners, stood quietly
      close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye,&rdquo; she cried breathlessly, then whisked
      herself from him and was gone, never looking back, but waving her hand as
      she rode. He sat motionless as she had left him. At the top of the distant
      hill, outlined against the dark sky, she drew in and stood. Dimly he saw
      the flutter of something white in her waving hand, and he drew from his
      breast her own handkerchief and waved in return. He pressed his hand
      across his eyes, and, when he saw more clearly, only the blank sky and the
      bare hilltop confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now curse the man who tries to stop me,&rdquo; growled Armstrong through his
      set teeth. &ldquo;I have been too mild with these ruffians. I&rsquo;ll break him
      across the pommel of my saddle as if he were a rotten spear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain began to fall once more as he passed again through Kirby Stephen,
      but he paid slight heed to it and pushed on to Penrith, where he bought a
      day&rsquo;s provender, so that he would have no need to make request for food as
      he neared the danger spot. Just before darkness set in, the sky cleared
      somewhat, and he saw ahead of him the gloomy bulk of Carlisle castle. He
      turned aside from the main road, and before the night became black found
      quarters for himself in a barn that contained some fodder for his horse.
      He threw himself down on the fragrant hay and slept peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the rain was again falling steadily. He reconnoitered his
      position. There was no dwelling near, and he determined to let his horse
      rest all that day and the next night, so that he should be in trim for
      anything that might happen when the pinch came. A day more or less could
      make little difference with the effectual guarding of the bridge, which
      was now doubtless held as strongly as it could be. He was convinced that
      success must depend ultimately on the speed of his horse, and he could not
      enter the contest with an exhausted animal. Bruce was never so carefully
      tended as on the day before the crisis, and as his intelligent head turned
      toward his master, he seemed to know that something unusual was afoot. On
      the second day Armstrong thought it best not to enter Carlisle too early
      in the morning. He wished to mingle with a crowd and not to ride the
      streets alone. The second night in the barn, with the rest of the day and
      night before, had left both himself and his horse fit to face anything
      that might ensue. The day was fine; the clouds had cleared away, and the
      sun was shining on the sodden ground. When he came in sight of the main
      road he saw what appeared to be an army marching North. He halted at the
      cross-road, in doubt regarding his next move. The men, in a long line,
      were on foot, trudging sullenly, wearily forward, water-soaked and
      mud-covered. No man looked up or seemed to take an interest in anything
      but the dismal work in hand. Far on toward the gates of Carlisle rode a
      group of horsemen, and at the rear another squad of mounted men encouraged
      the laggards to keep up for a little longer. Armstrong sat on his horse
      until the latter company was abreast of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Carlisle ahead, I hope,&rdquo; said one of the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Armstrong. &ldquo;Is this the Manchester contingent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Brutal weather we&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; growled the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that,&rdquo; assented William, cheerfully, falling into line with them,
      &ldquo;but it seems on the mend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, now that our march is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are likely to go farther afield, across country, when you reach
      Carlisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied the officer, gruffly, not too good-natured over
      the prospect. No one asked Armstrong who he was, and the elaborate fiction
      he had prepared to account for himself was not called for. The troopers
      were worn out by their contest with the elements and the roads, and all
      curiosity was dead in them. There stood Carlisle in front, and that was
      enough. The foot soldiers struggled on, in no definite order of formation,
      each doing the best he could. The officers rode silent behind them. Thus
      they all marched into Carlisle without question, and in their company the
      man the army was seeking. After a slight delay and pause in the streets
      the new troops moved on to the castle. Armstrong found no difficulty in
      falling behind, being thus free of the town. He knew every turn of every
      street and lane in the place as well as he knew the inside of his own
      pocket. He resolved to ride leisurely to the bridge, cut through the
      guard, if it did not prove too strong, and then trust to the spur. The
      town was thronged with military, but no one paid the slightest attention
      to him. As he jogged along very nonchalantly, more contented with the
      prospect than a few days before he would have thought possible, Bruce
      awoke the echoes by neighing loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old man, what did you that for?&rdquo; whispered William.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked ahead and was stricken speechless for the moment by seeing
      Frances Wentworth on her horse, without doubt a prisoner, two troopers
      riding on either side of her, and a young officer in front. She had
      unquestionably seen him, for her brow was wrinkled with anxiety; but her
      eyes gazed steadily past him into the distance. As he made toward the
      party they flashed one look of appeal upon him, which said as plainly as
      words, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, ride on and do not recognize me!&rdquo;&mdash;but the
      young man was oblivious to everything except the fact that she was in some
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going with this lady?&rdquo; he demanded of the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well ask,&rdquo; said the man, in no accent of pleasure. &ldquo;We have come
      across country to Carlisle under orders from one in authority, and now we
      must hale her back to Durham, where General Cromwell is stationed; and
      those are the orders of some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is all a mistake,&rdquo; cried William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; said the man, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady is the sister of Captain Wentworth of our army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she says. Others say she is the woman who was with the Scotch
      renegade. I know nothing of it and care less. I obey orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Frances, coldly, &ldquo;I beg you not to interfere. It is a mistake
      that will be explained in due time, but these men must do as they are
      told. That much you should know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although her words were spoken harshly enough, her eloquent eyes were
      bringing him to his senses and a realization of the unwisdom and futility
      of his behaviour. Before he could speak again, a sharp voice behind him
      rang out: &ldquo;Why are you loitering there? Get on with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without turning, he knew who the speaker was, and if he had not, the gleam
      of fear in the girl&rsquo;s eyes might have warned him of peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man questions my orders,&rdquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man has a right to question your orders. Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong was edging away, but De Courcy spurred the horse he rode in a
      semicircle to cut off his retreat. Instantly the Frenchman raised a shout
      that echoed through the streets of the town, and arrested every foot
      within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Scot! The Scot!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Stop that man; never mind the woman.
      After him. Sound the signal and close the bridge. The thousand pounds are
      mine, by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Bruce was doing his best down the main street of Carlisle. A dozen
      shots spattered fire harmlessly, and a big bell began to toll. Armstrong
      was well ahead of the troopers who followed him, and he gained ground at
      every stride. The pursuers were continually augmented from each lane and
      alley, and came thundering after the flying man like a charge of cavalry.
      A turn in the road brought the bridge in sight, and Armstrong saw it was
      guarded only at the end nearest him, and that merely by two lone pikemen.
      He would mow them down like grass, he said to himself, as he drew his
      sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;The Scot is loose, and we&rsquo;re after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men jumped aside, glad they were not called upon to arrest such a
      progress as they beheld coming down upon them. It was apparently one of
      their own officers who commanded them, and there was neither time to think
      or question. As the horse&rsquo;s hoofs struck the bridge, the deep crash of a
      cannon boomed from the castle, and before the fugitive reached the centre
      there arose at the other end of the bridge&mdash;he could not guess from
      whence they came&mdash;a troop of horse, as if the thunder of the gun had
      called the company magically from the earth. Bruce stopped on the crown of
      the bridge, at a touch of the rein, quivering with excitement, raised his
      head, and gave a snort of defiance at the blockade ahead of him. Armstrong
      glanced back; the bridge had closed on him like a trap, both ends stopped
      by forces impossible for one man to contend against.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cannon-shot did it. Well planned,&rdquo; he growled to himself, his horse
      now drawn across the bridge, alert for the word of command whatever it
      might be. Below, the swollen Eden, lipping full from bank to bank, rolled
      yellow and surly to the sea. Right and left, at either end of the bridge,
      stood a mass of steel-clad men, impregnable as the walls of the castle
      itself. De Courcy sprang off his horse and advanced with a valour which
      Armstrong, sitting there, apparently calm, had not given him credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my man,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Shoot him dead if he raises his hand.&rdquo; Then to
      the Scot. &ldquo;Surrender quietly. You have no chance. A score of muskets are
      turned on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they shoot, some of them will wing you. Better warn them not to fire,&rdquo;
       replied Armstrong mildly, as if proffering to a friend advice which did
      not concern himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you surrender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and take me, if you are anxious for the thousand pounds. It&rsquo;s worth
      the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman hesitated, edging cautiously along the parapet, so that if
      his friends shot he would be as much as possible aside from the line of
      fire. Seemingly his confidence in their marksmanship had not been
      augmented by Armstrong&rsquo;s warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you raise your hand to a weapon,&rdquo; said De Courcy, &ldquo;they will fire on
      you, and I cannot stop them. They will not wait my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I shall not raise my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman dashed forward and seized the bridle of Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come quietly,&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Armstrong. He leaned forward; said sharply to his horse,
      &ldquo;Over, my lad!&rdquo; and smote him a rising blow on the shoulder with his open
      hand. The horse raised his powerful front, and stood poised for a moment
      like a statue, then launched himself into space. As De Courcy felt his
      feet leave the stones, he let go the rein and fell sprawling on the
      parapet, but Armstrong leaned over and grasped him by the loose folds of
      his doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down with me, you traitor!&rdquo; he cried. There was a scream of terror,
      and the next instant the river roared in Armstrong&rsquo;s ears. When he came to
      the surface he shook his head like a spaniel, swept the water from his
      eyes, and looked aloft at the great bridge. The parapet was lined with
      troopers, all stricken motionless, as if they had been transformed to
      stone. De Courcy, one moment afloat, shrieked for help, then sank again.
      Armstrong knew that the paralysis on the bridge would not last long, and
      he turned his horse toward the bank of raw clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one in command up there, apparently,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;We must make the
      most of it, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The panting horse, breathing laboriously, essayed the bank and slipped
      back. Armstrong let loose his sodden cloak and flung it on the flood,
      turning the horse that he might take the ascent at an angle. The crowd
      still stared at him as if it were a show they had come out to see. Bruce,
      his feet once more on firm ground, shook his mane and gave forth a wild
      whinny of delight. Now the voice of command came in a blast of anger from
      the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After him, you fools! What are you staring at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, my lads, I think,&rdquo; ventured William, as he leaped his horse
      across the ditch that divided the fields from the road. Once the followers
      came near him, and he turned in his saddle, threatening them with his
      pistols, and they, forgetting that his powder was water-soaked, fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troopers found no difficulty in believing that a man who jumped his
      horse over Carlisle bridge into the Eden was directly aided by the devil,
      as had been rumoured, and they made no doubt the powder would soon dry on
      such a pit-scorched favourite as he. They felt sure he could put the
      pistols to deadly use in case of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment Bruce struck his hoofs on the road the horses behind had
      no chance of overtaking him. They fell farther and farther to the rear,
      and at last the silvery Esk gleamed ahead, while all along, since pursuit
      grew hopeless, William had been feasting his eyes on the blue hills of
      Scotland. He walked his horse through the Esk, but it, too, had been
      swollen by the rains, and Bruce again had to swim for it before he reached
      the other side. William sprang to the ground, flung his arms round the
      neck of his sterling companion, laying his cheek against that of the
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won the race, my boy. All the credit is to you, and Bruce, my lad,
      poets will sing of you.&rdquo; Then, with a choking in his throat, he knelt down
      and kissed the soil, the sensible horse looking on in wonder. As the young
      man rose to his feet and saw, on the other side of the Esk, the troopers
      lining up, his mood changed, and he laughed aloud. Drawing forth his
      leathern bottle, he held it aloft and shouted to them: &ldquo;Come over, lads,
      and I&rsquo;ll give you a drink. Don&rsquo;t be feared; none o&rsquo; the water got into
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the officer dared not cross the boundary, Cromwell&rsquo;s orders had been
      strict, so he and his men stood glum, making no response to the generous
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s to us a&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried William, raising the bottle to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my friends,&rdquo; he continued, replacing the flask and springing
      into the saddle, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be so down in the mouth. You&rsquo;ve seen a Scotchman
      run, which was more than your ancestors saw at Bannockburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he rode for Traquair Castle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;ACCOMPLISHMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s evening drew on,
      the old warder of Traquair Castle beheld a sight that caused him to rub
      his eyes in the fear that they were misleading him. A horseman bearing the
      guise of a Roundhead trooper, his steel cap glittering, approached the
      ancient stronghold. That such a man dared set foot on Scottish soil and
      ride thus boldly to the home of the most noted Royalist on the Border
      seemed incredible, but the warder was not to be caught napping, and he
      gave orders that the gates be closed and guarded, for the Border was ever
      a land of surprises, and one must take all precaution. Doubtless this lone
      trooper had a company concealed somewhere, and was advancing to parley,
      although he carried no flag of truce. He came on with a fine air of
      indifference, and stopped when he found his way barred, sitting carelessly
      on his horse with an amused smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer wull, surr?&rdquo; demanded the warder from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied the horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whut&rsquo;s it? I dinna unnerstaun&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wull&rsquo;s ma name,&rdquo; said the rider with an accent as broad as that of his
      questioner. &ldquo;Wuz that no&rsquo; whut ye were spierin&rsquo;? Dinna staun glowerin&rsquo;
      there, Jock Tamson, like an oolet or a gowk. Can ye no&rsquo; see Ah&rsquo;m English?
      Gang awa&rsquo; and tell yer maister that a freen o&rsquo; Crummle&rsquo;s at th&rsquo; door an&rsquo;
      craves a word wi&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod!&rdquo; cried the Bewildered warder, scratching his head, &ldquo;if ye hae a
      tongue like that on ye since ye crossed the Border, ye&rsquo;ve made the maist
      o&rsquo; yer time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Yerl o&rsquo; Traquair in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s jist that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then rin awa&rsquo; an&rsquo; gi&rsquo;e ma message, for Ah&rsquo;m wet an&rsquo; tired an&rsquo; hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warder sought Traquair in his library, where he sat, an anxious man,
      with many documents spread out on a table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer lordship, there&rsquo;s a soldier in the uniform of the English rebels at
      th&rsquo; gates, wha says he&rsquo;s a freen o&rsquo; Crummle&rsquo;s, and begs a word wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Earl, frowning, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve caught poor Armstrong, then, and
      now, in addition to our troubles, we&rsquo;ll need to bargain with that fiend
      Noll to save his neck. Everything is against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be an Englisher, but he&rsquo;s got a Scotch accent as broad as th&rsquo;
      Tweed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of our countrymen fighting for Cromwell, and therefore thought
      by that shrewd villain the better emissary. Bring him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be others o&rsquo; his like in hiding, ma Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the gates after him, then, and keep a strict watch. There&rsquo;s no
      danger on that score yet, but lippen to nothing. This man&rsquo;s just come to
      strike a bargain, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afraid we must dance to the tune he pipes. Bring
      him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When William and the warder came in together, a moment or two passed
      before the Earl recognized his visitor, then he sprang forward and held
      out both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Armstrong, is this you?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What have they done to
      you? Save us all! Who has shorn and accoutred you like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The necessities of the chase, Traquair. This is a disguise, and although
      you saw through it, I&rsquo;m happy to think I deluded Jock Tamson there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh!&rdquo; cried Tamson, peering forward, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll never threep doon ma throat
      that this is Wull Armstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir William, if you please, Tamson,&rdquo; corrected the new knight. &ldquo;The title
      was bestowed upon me by his Majesty himself, and I shall expect that
      deference from the lower orders, Tamson, which the designation calls for.
      Still, Jock, I&rsquo;ll forgive your familiarity if you&rsquo;ll help me off with this
      helmet, that seems glued to my skull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man grasped the edges of the steel cap with both his hands when
      Armstrong bent his head. He braced his foot against that of the
      helmet-wearer, and pulled with all his might, but his strength was unequal
      to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord pity us!&rdquo; growled Will, &ldquo;catch me ever putting my head in a trap
      like this again. I&rsquo;ll have to take it off with a boot-jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring in Angus,&rdquo; laughed the Earl, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll pull either the helmet or the
      head off you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huge Angus came lumbering in after the warder, who went in search of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had your supper, Angus?&rdquo; asked the Earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us see what strength it&rsquo;s given you. Tug this iron pot from
      Armstrong&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angus, bracing himself as the warder had done, jerked ineffectually
      several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull, ye deevil,&rdquo; cried Armstrong. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve no more strength than a
      three-year-old wean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m feart to thraw yer neck,&rdquo; protested Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the neck. Being hanged by Cromwell is as nothing to this.
      Pull, ye gomeral! Am I to go about with my head in a metal bucket all my
      life? Pull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angus put forth his strength, and the helmet gave way with unexpected
      suddenness, whereupon Angus sat down on the floor with a thud like an
      earthquake, the steel cap in his lap. Traquair slapped his thigh and
      roared till the rafters rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, you&rsquo;ll be an inch taller after that. I never saw the like of it.
      I&rsquo;ve heard that a man&rsquo;s head grows with new honors placed upon him, but I
      had no idea it was so bad as that. Man, where&rsquo;s your hair? And did they
      chop it off with a battle-axe? If that&rsquo;s a fair example of barber&rsquo;s work
      in England, I&rsquo;m glad I live in Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong rubbed his shorn head slowly with his open palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A barber may have other qualities than expertness with the shears,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trick of the shears is surely the chief equipment for the trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re in the right. My hair was cut in a stable-yard under the
      moonlight, with great haste and blunt blades. We will see what your own
      poll-man can do in still shortening the result. I have been hotly chased,
      Traquair, and hair-cutting was the least drawback that troubled me. I
      think my tailoring is even worse than my barbering, and there, also, you
      must stand my friend. Is the Castle tailor out of work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My whole wardrobe is at your disposal, Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in it would fit me, and I am a thought particular about a new
      dress, as I have lost all self-respect in this one. I may borrow a hat
      from you, if you have one of the latest fashion, with a fine feather on
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! What&rsquo;s come over you, Will? Some lady in the Court of Charles? You
      didn&rsquo;t fash much over your clothes in the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fash much now, as you may see by my array. Still, it is n&rsquo;t duds,
      but food that is the first necessity. I&rsquo;ve had nothing all day but a
      hurried drink out of the Eden. It was as thick as brose, and about the
      same colour, but not so sustaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re preparing supper for you now, and I&rsquo;ll bear you company when it&rsquo;s
      ready. I&rsquo;m eager to hear what befell. So the King knighted you. Deed, he
      might have gone farther than that and made you a marquis or a duke at the
      same cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he offered me anything in his gift if I brought the commission safely
      through to you,&mdash;a promise that I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll never trouble him
      to redeem. Nevertheless, here&rsquo;s the packet, a little damp, but none the
      worse for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed the cause of all the trouble on the table, and Traquair turned
      it over and over in his hands, with no great delight in its possession, as
      the messenger thought. The Earl sighed as he opened it at last and slowly
      perused its contents in silence, laying it on the table again when he had
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonderful man, William,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If every one in Scotland did
      his duty as thoroughly as you do it, we would soon place the King on his
      throne again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there more trouble brewing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More trouble, and the old trouble, and the new trouble. Every one pulling
      his own way, and in all directions, thinking only of himself, and never by
      any chance of the interests of the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I tell Cromwell that? He seemed at some pains to intercept a billet
      that you receive but lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Cromwell! You&rsquo;re never going to write to that scoundrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to see him before the week is past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You&rsquo;re not such a fool as to put yourself in Cromwell&rsquo;s clutch
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, I wonder at you. Angus got the steel bonnet off you with some work,
      but no man in Scotland can get Cromwell&rsquo;s rope off your neck if once you
      thrust your head through the noose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell&rsquo;s not such a fool as to hang me. If he did, it would but unite
      your wavering hosts like an invasion of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a heavy price to pay for union, Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price will never be paid. Cromwell knows what he wants, and he does
      n&rsquo;t want me now, however anxious he was for my company this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you actually seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him the first day I crossed the Border. I saw him once again, and I
      travelled over most of England on a pass from his own hand. Cromwell and I
      have a mutual respect for each other by this time, but there are some
      matters of difference between us that I think will best be settled by word
      of mouth, so I&rsquo;m off day after to-morrow to foregather with him. I cannot
      go sooner, because my new gear will not be ready, and I want to give the
      General time to withdraw his troops from across the country, so that I may
      come on him in other fettle than as a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the woman, Will? I knew you would go clean daft when you met her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind. As the Border is a land of nobility and romance, we will
      call her an Earl&rsquo;s daughter to please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More like some peasant girl who assisted you to escape from your
      enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whoever she is, Traquair, I&rsquo;ll make her Mrs. Armstrong when I get
      the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Armstrong, you mean. You&rsquo;re forgetting your new dignity. Surely if
      the case stands thus you will ask the King to fulfill his promise and make
      you a baron at the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I not. I&rsquo;ll trouble the badgered man no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the ways of the sex better than you do, and I warrant you the lady
      will give you no rest until the title&rsquo;s yours, whenever she knows you have
      earned it and have had the offer of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks less of these things than I do, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is no peasant lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, greatly to the delight of Armstrong, whose answers were
      becoming more and more short, his supper was announced, and Traquair with
      his arm over the shoulder of his guest, led him to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor came when supper was finished, and measured his new customer,
      received minute directions concerning the garments, and retired protesting
      he would do his best in the limited time allowed him. The barber operated
      as well as he could on a head that began to nod in spite of the efforts of
      its owner. Sleep laid its heavy hand on Armstrong, and the voice of
      Traquair sounded distant and meaningless, something resembling the rush of
      Eden water in his ears, whereupon William nearly got those useful members
      cropped in earnest. At last he found himself in his room, and, for the
      first time since he left that hospitable mansion, enjoyed the luxury of
      lying between clean sheets with his clothes off. Then he slept as
      dreamlessly as his ancestors.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;MATRIMONY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> night, and a day,
      and a night rejuvenated the tired man and his horse. Clothed and in his
      right mind he was once more the gallant Borderer, ready to face whatever
      fortune had in store for him; on this occasion, so Traquair said, more
      superbly attired than ever had been the case before; but Armstrong held
      that this was merely interested praise of the Castle tailor. Traquair
      endeavoured to persuade him not to trust himself again on English soil,
      but his advice was unheeded, as is usually the fate of unasked counsel.
      Traquair wished him to take a bodyguard of a score or more, but Armstrong
      pointed out that unless he had an army at his back able to defeat
      Cromwell&rsquo;s forces all other assistance was useless. He risked everything
      upon his belief in Cromwell&rsquo;s common sense, and from this position nothing
      Traquair said could turn him. The Earl rode with him as far as the Esk,
      and there bade him good luck and God speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Armstrong had once gone over a road, he needed no other guide than
      his own memory and instinct of direction. He made directly for the
      farmsteading where first he had been arrested, and found it deserted; then
      took the route over which his captors had conducted him, expecting to
      reach Corbiton Manor before darkness set in. This plan was frustrated by
      the fact that he had allowed too scant time for the cordon across the
      country to be withdrawn. Cromwell was indeed calling in his men, and
      massing them at Carlisle, Newcastle, and Hexham, which latter town
      Armstrong&rsquo;s own ancestors had frequently pillaged. He learned of this
      movement from chance wayfarers, and was on the alert not to fall within
      the scope of any marching company. There was evidently no secret about
      Cromwell&rsquo;s intentions, and the Scot surmised that the General wished his
      plans to be well spread over the land, and thus overawe the Northerners in
      any hostile projects they might think of undertaking, showing his
      readiness to crush them if they ventured to set foot across the Border.
    </p>
    <p>
      About mid-day Armstrong caught sight of the first large body of men, and
      he was compelled to hide for several hours in a depression on the moor
      until they and the danger were past. This delay retarded his arrival at
      Corbiton Manor until after nightfall, when the full moon shone upon the
      ancient mansion, instead of the silver crescent which hung in the western
      sky when last he visited the place. It seemed incredible that the space of
      time could have been so short, for the events of a life were crowded into
      the interval. As he approached the ancient house, the challenge of a
      sentinel brought him to a stand, and called from the hall several
      officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Cromwell here?&rdquo; asked the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the headquarters of his Excellency, General Cromwell,&rdquo; said one
      of the officers, with some severity in his tone, a rebuke to the
      questioner&rsquo;s off-hand method of designation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man I mean,&rdquo; replied Armstrong. &ldquo;I never heard there were two
      of the name or the kind. Well; tell him that William Armstrong, who
      carried the commission from the King to Scotland, is here, and requires a
      private conference with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strong moonlight was shining on the back of the horseman, and in the
      faces of the officers. The latter did not obey the injunction laid upon
      them, but their leader gave, instead, a brief command, and in a moment two
      dozen pikemen surrounded the rider, who laughed heartily and said: &ldquo;My
      lads, you are too late. You should have done that trick several days
      since. Oliver will give you no thanks for it now. Go in and tell him I am
      here, and send some one to take charge of my horse while I talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief officer hesitated for a moment, then turned and disappeared
      within the mansion, while Armstrong dismounted and gave to the soldier who
      took his horse minute instructions touching the treatment of the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all good horsemen,&rdquo; said the visitor, in his most genial accents,
      &ldquo;and will doubtless respect Bruce here, whatever you think of his master;
      for this is the charger that louped over the parapet of Carlisle bridge,
      and, after that, beat the best you had in your cavalry in a race for the
      Border. If your chief should come to a disagreement with me, take care of
      the horse at least, for you have n&rsquo;t another like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse was led away, palpably admired by all the men, for some of them
      stroked and patted his flank, speaking soothingly to him. William stood
      with his hands in his pockets, the centre of a ring of armed men, his gay
      dress in striking contrast to the more sober uniform of his guards.
      Cromwell was taking his time making up his mind, and the young man thought
      this delay was not an encouraging sign. He had thrust his head between the
      lion&rsquo;s jaws, and the minutes that passed before he could know whether the
      brute was going to bite or not were irksome to him especially as there was
      now nothing to do but await the issue. At last the officer reappeared,
      dismissed the guard, and said curtly to the prisoner: &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong was ushered into the huge room which he remembered so well, and
      found Cromwell sitting alone at the table, as if he had never left it.
      Even the two candles stood where they had been placed before, but the face
      of the seated man seemed more inscrutable, more stern, than he recollected
      it. This was the leader of the Ironsides on the Northampton road, rather
      than the urbane man who had pretended to believe the story of the search
      for cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong swept off his feathered hat most courteously as he approached
      the table, bowed, and, standing at ease on the spot he had formerly
      occupied, said: &ldquo;Good evening, General!&rdquo; The General lifted his heavy eyes
      to the cropped head, now glistening in the light, and although his firm
      mouth remained immobile, the slightest suspicion of a twinkle scintillated
      for one brief moment in his searching glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening. You wished to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General, and have come from Scotland this very day for no other
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out of employment, perhaps, and are looking for re-engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, General, if I was, you are the man I should come to for a
      recommendation. In a manner of speaking, you are in the right. I have been
      riding hard this while back for other folk, and now I have taken a bit of
      journey on my own account. You see my case is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will state the case,&rdquo; interrupted Cromwell, menacingly. &ldquo;You stood here
      and lied to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sat there and did the same by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stood here and lied to me. You came as a spy, mixing with affairs
      that did not concern you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, General. I took service for my King, and you will be good
      enough to remember that Charles is King of Scotland, even if it pleases
      you to forget that he is King of England, and that he will be, till he
      dies, your King as well as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is King of Oxford solely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Let me tell you, you&rsquo;ll find that same Oxford a very hard nut
      to crack if you attempt to take it by assault. I went carefully around the
      fortifications, and would seek no better job than to hold it against you
      and your whole army. There would be many a cropped head low before you got
      mine in your clutches,&rdquo; and William passed his hand sympathetically over
      his denuded crown, as had become a custom with him. His questioner bent
      forward with more of eagerness than he had hitherto shown, all thought of
      the indictment he was heaping up seeming to pass from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is its weakest spot?&rdquo; he said, as one expert might seek counsel
      from another who had personal experience of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the beauty of it. There is no weakest spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not? We shall never need to take it by assault, but if that were
      thought best, it might be attacked from the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong raised his eyes to the ceiling and meditated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it would cost a&rsquo;wheen o&rsquo; men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; better men than are within its walls, and they shall not be
      sacrificed. I can wait, and the King cannot. You delivered the King&rsquo;s
      message to Traquair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s what I went for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have the impudence to come to me, thinking I will allow you to
      return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say confidence, rather. I am very sure you will allow me to return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, confidence is the word, but with a mixture of impudence as well; the
      malt and the hops. It never crossed your mind that it was a dungeon you
      were approaching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought if you did anything, it would be hanging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my death by rope would be just the little fillip that Scotland
      needs at the present moment. You thraw my neck, and the Scots are at yours
      before I am fairly happit in the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look upon yourself as important to your countrymen, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do nothing of the kind. Man, I wonder at both you and the King. Neither
      of you understand the Scottish nature in the least. If the King had any
      comprehension, he would have had the heather afire years since. A man may
      dawner about Scotland all his life, hungry and athirst, cold and in rags,
      getting fewer kickshaws than kicks, none paying heed or anything else to
      him, but let him die the death of a martyr, and his tired bones are more
      potent than ten thousand live men. Ma sang! I&rsquo;d like to see ye hang me!
      There&rsquo;s poor Traquair, at his wit&rsquo;s end for discouragement through
      dissension among the people and their leaders. You hang me, and you&rsquo;ve
      done the trick for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell leaned back in his chair, his lids partially closed, but they
      could not veil the look of admiration he cast upon the man standing before
      him, who spoke enthusiastically of his own execution as if it were rather
      a good joke on his opponent. For some moments the General kept silence,
      then he said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a commission in my army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a fighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, but I prefer to engage under Traquair&rsquo;s banner if he raises it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think I will let you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. The way is clear to Scotland, to Oxford, or where you
      please. What have you come to me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Frances Wentworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much. In this I cannot oblige you. With you I have nothing
      to do, and you are at liberty. That wench of Wentworth&rsquo;s stands on a
      different footing, inasmuch as she has proved traitor to her own. I shall
      do nothing to injure her, but she shall taste captivity until she
      confesses her error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is no traitor, but did well the work you set for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I set no work for her. &rsquo;Twas given to her brother, and his folly
      brought her into the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave your consent at Northampton; thus I say you set her to the task,
      and well she performed it. If your men had done your bidding as
      faithfully, I had never crossed the Esk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She connived at your escape from Lichfield, and elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but she was a free woman then, having fulfilled her duty to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quibbling. She is a traitor, and more honest than you; she admits
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say she is a true woman,&rdquo; cried Armstrong, red anger flushing his brow.
      The hot Border blood sprang into mastery for the first time during their
      controversy, and he failed to note that Cromwell remained cold as at the
      beginning, and might be negotiated with, if he had remembered the
      commander&rsquo;s resolve to enlist the Scot in his service. But before the
      General could give hint of a bargain, the impetuosity of the younger man
      left him only the choice of killing the Scot where he stood, or apparently
      succumbing to him, a most dangerous alternative had Armstrong to deal with
      one less schooled in the repression of his feelings than Cromwell. The
      ill-advised Borderer dropped his hat silently to the floor, flashed forth
      his sword, and presented it at his opponent&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you wear concealed armour,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was quiet in its
      intensity, almost a whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;but that will not help you. No human
      power can avail you at this moment, for if you cry out my blade advances,
      and a bit of your backbone sticks to the point of it. You see I cannot
      help myself, but must kill you unless I get your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell sat rigid, not a muscle of face or body moving. The sword was
      held as steady as a beam of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you to heed me,&rdquo; continued the young man, seeing the other did
      not intend to speak. &ldquo;I implore you, as if I were on my bended knees
      before you, and my life in your hands, instead of yours in mine. Will you
      let the great affairs of state be jeopardized to thwart two lovers? With
      you slain, the King wins, for there is none in England can fill your
      place. Have you sons and daughters of your own that your heart goes out
      to? Think of them, and be kind to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you marry the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, before you depart together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here and now, if there is one to knot us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that a promise given under coercion does not hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well, but the word of General Cromwell is enough for me, once
      it is passed, however given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take down your sword; I promise, and am well rid of you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a deep sigh of relief Armstrong sheathed his sword and lifted his hat
      from the floor. Cromwell rose from his chair and paced twice up and down
      the long room between the great moonlit windows and the table. He paused
      in his march, looked up at the dim gallery, and said: &ldquo;Cobb, come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Armstrong&rsquo;s amazement, who thought he had been alone with the General,
      he heard lurching heavy steps come clumping down the wooden stair, and a
      trooper, with primed musket in his hand, stood before his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cobb, why did you not shoot this man dead when you saw him draw his
      sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Excellency, you did not give the signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a dead man before he could move an arm, or your finger was on the
      table again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well. That is what I like; exact obedience, and no panic.
      Keep your lips closed. Go and tell your colonel to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man withdrew, and Cromwell resumed his walk, making no comment on the
      brief dialogue. William blew a long whistle, then he laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the colonel came in, Cromwell turned to him and said: &ldquo;Is that
      malignant brawler, chaplain to Lord Rudby, in the cells yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your men to clear out the chapel at once and light it. There are
      some stores in it, I think, and bring the reverend greybeard to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the colonel returned, accompanied by an aged clergyman,
      who, despite his haggard and careworn look and bent shoulders, cast a
      glance of hatred at the General, which seemed to entitle him to the
      epithet Cromwell had bestowed upon him. To this silent defiance Cromwell
      paid no attention, but said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you may earn your liberty to-night by marrying two young people in
      the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I not,&rdquo; returned the clergyman stoutly, &ldquo;and all your tyranny
      cannot compel me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wench,&rdquo; continued Cromwell, unmoved, &ldquo;you already know. She is
      Frances Wentworth, daughter of the late Earl of Strafford. The groom
      stands here before you; William Armstrong, a Scot, who has but lately
      carried a message from the man Charles, at Oxford, to Traquair on the
      Border. I should hang him, but he prefers the noose you can tie to the one
      my hands might prepare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman looked at Armstrong with an interest he had not
      displayed on entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, seen his gracious Majesty, the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, reverend sir, and but a few days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And carried his message safe through these rebellious hordes now
      desecrating the land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was some opposition, but I won through, thanks to my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thanks, no doubt, to your own loyal courage. God bless you, sir, and
      God save the King. The lady you have chosen is worthy of you, as you of
      her. In God&rsquo;s shattered temple, I will marry you, if its walls remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the colonel came in with Frances, the girl turned a frightened look
      upon the group as she saw who stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried impulsively, &ldquo;I told you not to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you who are to obey, not he,&rdquo; said Cromwell harshly. &ldquo;He has
      come for you. Will you marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl allowed her eyes to seek the floor, and did not answer him. Even
      in the candle-light her cheeks burned rosy red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried Cromwell impatiently, &ldquo;yes, or no, wench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not have her so addressed by any,&rdquo; spoke up Armstrong, stoutly
      stepping forward; but the girl flashed a glance from her dark eyes on the
      commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with decision, then directed her look on her lover, and
      so to the floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there candles in the chapel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency,&rdquo; replied the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring some of the officers,&mdash;I think witnesses are needed,&mdash;and
      your regimental book, if there is signing to be done. &rsquo;Twill hold
      them as fast as the parish register, I warrant.&rdquo; Then to the clergyman,
      &ldquo;Follow me, sir, and the rest of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Cromwell strode out and led the way to the chapel, so hastily
      converted from a storehouse to its former purpose. The old divine took his
      place with the young people before him, the group of officers in the
      dimness near the door. Cromwell, however, stood near the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slip off one of your rings and give it to this pastor,&rdquo; he whispered to
      her. &ldquo;We are short of such gear here, and I doubt if your man ever thought
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances, without a word, selected from the number on her fingers that
      which had been her mother&rsquo;s wedding-ring, and handed it to the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and
      in the face of this congregation, to join together this Man and this Woman
      in holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate, instituted of God in the
      time of man&rsquo;s innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is
      betwixt Christ and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned and
      beautified with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of
      Galilee</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the sonorous words resounded in the ancient chapel, the old man
      straightened himself, the former anger in his face gave way to a benignant
      expression, and his attitude took on all the grave dignity of his calling.
      He went on with the service until he came to the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell stepped forward and said brusquely, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman seemed to have forgotten the Commander&rsquo;s presence, and now
      paused when it was recalled to him; then he went on to the end, and added,
      in a voice trembling with emotion: &ldquo;God bless you, my children, sworn to
      love and cherish each other in this time of hatred and war. May you live
      to see what my aged eyes may never behold,&mdash;peace upon this
      distracted land, and the King upon an unchallenged throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, and amen!&rdquo; said the deep voice of Cromwell, &ldquo;provided the word
      &lsquo;righteous&rsquo; is placed before the word &lsquo;King&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more on horseback, and clear of Corbiton Manor, her hand stole into
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are willing, I will take the way known to me, and lead you to my
      home; to-morrow you may take the way known to you, and lead me to yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances, I am ready to follow wherever you lead.&rdquo; And so they went forth
      together in the glamour of the moonlight.
    </p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
